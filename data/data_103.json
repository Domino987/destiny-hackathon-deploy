She took care of me and my babies until we could all be safely caught and placed into foster homes. My babies have all found forever homes and now it's my turn. I need a home where someone is home most of the time to care for me and gain my trust. I am very sweet but very scared. No children please as I am terrified of every one but my foster mom and I need someone that will patient with me, love me and give me a chance. I cannot be let out because I will run away and you won't catch me. I can dig out too so I need a fence I can't get out of or under. I would love to be someone's house dog and be treated like a queen. My former family was very mean to me and that's why I am scared of people. The vet says I am about 2 years old.\n\nMy adoption fee is $200 and will include all my vaccines, spay and microchip. Fill out an app at www.soca-fbc.org under the adoptables tab.",

If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced.

            "description": "Say hello to Elijah! This ten-year-old pit bull is a total sweetheart who loves to sleep. In fact, his foster mom says if he were one of the Seven Dwarves, he would be Sleepy! He would love to rest his head in his forever home. Elijah is a great cuddler. He loves being by his humans at all times, but also enjoys a break from them to lay in the grass or dirt. He is blind but hears pretty well, so slow introductions are a must for him. But once he knows someone, he's a friend for life! Elijah is housetrained and does well on a leash once he gets comfortable with his surroundings. He also gets along well with other dogs and kids, but only with a slow introduction so he's not startled or scared. Elijah is a very affectionate boy who will wander around the house looking for his people, and then is so happy when he finds them. An ideal home for him would be a relaxed one so he's not startled. He loves bonding with his humans so he'd love a family that could be with him most of the time. This old boy deserves the perfect forever home. Could that be with you? Apply to adopt Elijah today! This pet is available for pre-adoption and may not be officially ready for adoption, as it is still undergoing medical treatment. Depending on the medical status, a Meet and Greet may be put on hold until they can safely participate in a meeting with potential adopters. In some cases, this pet may be able to move to its forever home while it is still under the medical care of Dallas Pets Alive. If you are interested in learning more, apply now and one of our Adoption Counselors will discuss the options available so you can bring home your new furry family member! Applications are processed in the order in which they are received; please be aware that this pet may have interested applicants ahead of you. All Dallas Pets Alive adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon adoption.

            "description": "This handsome tall drink of water is Rio! His interests include fetch, swimming, fetch, treats, fetch, and gently leaning into your leg for pets. We should also mention that he loves playing fetch and will regularly do leaps and flips in the air trying to catch the ball. And he's really great at bringing the ball back to you and dropping it. If he thinks you don't see the ball on the ground, he'll politely pick it up and set it in your lap. Rio manages to keep the game going with even the laziest of tennis ball throwers! True to his name, Rio also really LOVES being in the water! Whether you're hosing him off or taking him for a dip in a pool or creek, he'll take all the water time he can get. And while he is incredibly energetic when playing with a ball or in the water, when he's all tuckered out, he's happy to hang out with his person and snuggling. Rio can be aloof with people he doesn't know, but he warms up quickly and before long he's asking for belly rubs and cuddles. Rio's a big guy, but he is very easy to walk on leash and enjoys going a nice quiet walk around the neighborhood, taking in all the sights and smells while staying by your side at a nice pace. He's also a smart pup who sits politely for treats and recently became TOP Dog Ready, which means he has already learned all the skills in his training plan in APA!'s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Rio has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Dogs in the program learn skills including sitting calmly when approached by strangers, calmly walking past another dog, staying in a sit or down until told 'free,' and coming when called. In addition, Rio has also learned 'Place'. Rio has worked hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Rio after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 In addition to his TOP Dog training, Rio is a pro at crate training and is perfectly content to wait patiently for you to come home and play a game of fetch. While he's never met a tennis ball he doesn't like, he can be pretty picky about his canine friends and would do best as an only dog in an adult-only home. Rio's an easy friend who's easy to please and he's more than ready to move on to his forever home. Come meet this handsome guy today! Follow Rio on Instagram @riosbigadventure and @rio.plus.1",

She loves wrestling with her puppy pals and going for walks. She is loving and loves to be near her person snuggling on the couch or watching whatever you\u2019re doing. She will need someone who has space for her to run and is able to keep her active to expend her energy.\" She weighs about 42 lbs. and may get slightly larger but is just about full grown. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone.

He is good with people, we recommend any children should be over 12 because if a child would try to take his food, he would be reactive. He is not fond of most other animals. He is housetrained. Zeus has been adopted a couple of times, but it just wasn't the right home either time. He would love a fenced yard where he can lay in the sun or explore. Please help this sweet boy find his own family to love!\n\nHe has had a rabies shot, 7-way shot, bordetella, and been wormed. He is also neutered, microchipped, and heartworm negative.***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS? CONTACT pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com\nOur adoption fee is $150 which covers a portion of the dog's vetting costs. The adoption process includes the completion of an application followed by an interview.\nClick here to submit an adoption application: https://pcpoundpuppies.webs.com/adoption-application\n***IMPORTANT: Due to the effects of COVID-19, our Sunday adoption events at Pet Food Center have been canceled until further notice. If there is a dog you are interested in meeting, be sure to contact us and we may be able to set up a meet and greet as soon as possible.***\nYou can get in touch with us by email at pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com or by phone at 812-483-4341 for more information.\nWe respond to inquiries and adoption applications at our earliest opportunity, but please be patient with us as we work full-time jobs and perform this service as volunteers. We do our best to return messages and schedule adoption interviews within a couple of days of receiving your application.\nThe fastest way to get the ball rolling is to complete an adoption application for the dog that caught your eye. Thank you for considering the adoption of a shelter dog!",

            "description": "Maybe were biased but we feel Maximus is the handsomest seven year-old Pitty around! This big smile has been through SO MUCH and has overcome a really long battle of neglect. He was very sick when we rescued him but is better now! Maximus does have heart failure but can still play and walk like the champ he is. But that has not stopped him from giving snuggles, love and gently romping around. Hes completely trained too! Were talking: leash trained, house trained, he knows things like sit and even stay! Hell even sit still for you while you clip his nails! He loves going for short walks. He is not good with small pets of any kind. Maximus doesnt need a fence since he only needs a short amount of exercise. He is a big boy close to 80 lbs. Would do best in a home as the only male dog. He's wonderful with females though, you could say he loves the ladies! This big boy has lots of snuggles and love to give. Please help us find a good home for him!\n\nThe adoption fee for this handsome man is $150. He has been neutered, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines!\n\nWant to meet Maximus? Submit an adoption application and someone will be in touch to schedule a meet n greet to see if hes the right match for you!",

Our veterinary staff can perform the surgery to correct this condition, but he must recover in a foster home.\nIs there anyone out there who can foster Kilt? He would need to be kept separate from other animals and will do best around adults only.\nKilt is a friendly dog who knows several commands and listens well. While he likes to play, he is medium-low energy. In his previous foster home, he was house trained and he keeps his kennel clean at the shelter.\nKilt is 2.8 y/o and 65 pounds.",

Barea is constantly exploring and observing everything. Proper introductions with other dogs would be best for Barea, but he co-exists with two other dogs in his foster home. He has a bed inside his kennel where he occasionally likes to chill and go in and out as he pleases but sleeps in bed with his humans.

He was also very thin so he may have been on his own for awhile. He was been seen by a vet and his wounds are now healed. He is 4-5 years old, neutered, flea treated, heartworm/lymes negative, microchipped. Sparrow is a happy dog who loves to play. He does need to be an only pet though. He has a high energy level, so it is not recommended that he be around children. You must own your home and have a fenced in yard. Sparrow will bring many hours of fun and joy to anyone lucky enough to give him a loving home. **Applications will not be screened if they do not meet the listed requirements.**",

A rescue agreed to take me when I was just an hour away from being euthanized. I was so sick though I didnt even realize what was going on. I was taken immediately to the emergency vet where they stabilized my condition and was then transferred to the rescues regular vet. Theyve run a bunch of tests and it was found that I had a uti, thyroid disease, and cushings disease. Im now on medication to help manage everything. I am finally feeling better now. Im going to need my medicine for the rest of my life though. I like to be the center of attention (meaning I dont care for other dogs), so I would need a home by myself or be able to be kept separated. I havent been around cats, but I can be tested with them. I am a very sweet little girl. Ive already been spayed. Im up to date on vaccinations, heartworm/lymes negative, flea treated, wormed, and microchipped. Im also crate trained. I do have occasional accidents but hopefully once the cushings is controlled that will get better. Please consider helping me out by fostering me or better yet giving me a forever home. Potential adopters need to realize that Olivia will need to remain on medication for the remainder of her life. This is a must! ** Applications will not be screened if they do not meet the listed requirements.**",

            "description": "Mr. Al Bino is a 2 year old cream doberman boy who came to us as a stray. He was really difficult to catch and it took them a couple weeks to get him. Due to this we do not recommend a home for him that ever has him off leash except in a fenced yard. He is good with female dogs but not male dogs. He needs to be an only dog or in a home with a female dog only. He loves to cuddle with his foster mom but he is a nervous nelly and he will circle and growl at his butt from time to time. He can be anxious at times but does relax. He does best with a routine and schedule where he knows what to expect when. We want the best for this boy and would prefer someone with doberman experience that understands not only male to male aggression but also the issues that can come along with him. \n\nThe adoption fee for this handsome boy is $225. He has been neutered, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines!\n\nWant to meet Mr. Al Bino? Submit an adoption application and someone will be in touch to schedule a meet n greet to see if hes the right match for you!",

After spending a LOT of time with my EARS Foster Family, we have decided on what the IDEAL Forever Home for me should be.  I prefer having a single man as my person.  I'm not happy being around kids or other animals.  I enjoy spending time with that person who is active, energetic and will keep me busy.  He could even give me a job!  I'd like that.  Do you want to hear about what is one of my FAVORITE things ever?  I LOVE to be in the water,  I would be happy to be in the water or pool ALL DAY if you were in there with me!  If you think you are that Alpha male who can help me learn my place in the pack while welcoming and building up my good traits, then you might just be my PERFECT IDEAL FOREVER HOME.  If you are ready, willing and able to make a commitment to ME, please contact EARS so that we can meet and hopefully bond.",

Nala is loyal, energetic and well behaved.  She is good with male dogs but is a dominant female dog and would do best either as a solo dog or with male dogs as a companion.  Nala takes some time to warm up to new people and needs someone who can manage her interactions with new humans.  She does not care for children and should not be around kids.  Nala is crate trained, house trained and has nice manners.  She is well behaved when left home alone and is not destructive.  Nala is athletic and would love hikes and runs in the woods.

He sat there for almost a week.....his euthanasia date was set but that didn't stop ICARe president Margaret from doing everything possible to save his life. After many, many phone calls and emails we got Sonny to safety and more importantly to see the vet! Tests were done showing a spinal cord injury that will not heal. Sonny had no use of his back legs. He also could not urinate on his own so his bladder had to be expressed manually. Let me tell you how amazing this dog is. He can now urinate on his own AND even more amazing is Sonny is getting therapy and regaining the function in his back legs. He can take several steps and stand on his own! Sonny has some wheels to help him get around on longer walks as his front end is very strong and he is perfectly capable of going all over! Sonny needs a special, special forever home. A family that will love him and treat him like a king.",

He is calm in his kennel with us, but he does not like to be crated and will break out of a small crate.  He loves car rides and is great at riding shotgun.  He is an incredible dog that deserves a chance to be loved, which he will return as your best friend.  Don't pass him by just because he is labelled as a Pit Bull.  He has not been marred by people that exploit this loving, loyal breed and we intend to help him stay that way.  Jennings is a thin 55 lbs. and should grow to 65 or 70 lbs.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations. If you would like an adoption application, please send an email message to adoptprebleco@yahoo.com",

This tiny pup had been left behind by his family in an empty apartment for who knows how long with nothing but rat poison and antifreeze. After seeing this poor puppy coughing up blood, our rescue partners knew that he would require immediate medical attention and the help of a rescue if he were going to have any chance of survival, so they contacted us to see if we would be able to help. We knew we had to help, and he was immediately transported to AEC.\n\nAs we suspected, Cole has ingested rat poison, and based on his X-rays, he had also ingested something sharp. Cole required an immediate blood transfusion, and thanks to our Napoleons Hero's program, we have a list of Streetdogs (adoptable and alum) who have been blood type tested! And lucky for Cole, we had two healthy eligible dogs, #sdfDannyZuko and alum #sdfVanGogh, who mobilized to help their newest Streetdog family member!\n\nUpdate 5/1: Cole has spent the past couple of days at Grace for further treatment and to monitor his vitals, and we are so happy to report that this sweet little boy is doing great! His platelet counts are up, and it appears that the sharp object previously seen on his x-ray has passed! Now that he is gaining weight with small, frequent meals, he's looking and feeling so much better! And today, he was even able to make a few new friends (dog and cat) and spend some time with his new dog friends outside in the yard! Cole will move to a medical foster soon, where he will continue to receive regular treatment and be closely monitored.\n\n* Behaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

Cooper is okay with cats and has played well with other dogs at the rescue.  \n\nAlthough he is 3 years old, Cooper is still an adolescent and exhibits an adolescent's quirky  behavior. Cooper acts like a big cuddly goofball most of his day, but like most large breed dogs does not realize how big he is. Cooper is not your calm laid back Pyr!  Occasionally he may pick up an item not his own, so he does need some supervision.  \nCooper's other quirk is that is does not like trucks. As usual, there is a reason for his attitude, and his previous home had a fence in front of the house. Cooper at times overreacts to loud trucks. Cooper like most pyrs needs a fenced yard. His new owners must continue to work with him to keep him from back sliding.\n\nIf you would like more information about Cooper, or would like to schedule a time to meet him, please contact us at 920-293-8885 or wooflodge@yahoo.com. All of our dogs are current on vaccinations and are spayed or neutered.\n\n",

Unless he is distracted by his environment (i.e. another dog), he wants to give people a big slobbery hello.\n\nHe has Medium energy. Loves to walk. But will also take a decent amount of time during the day to take a good snooze.\n\nHe is a very reactive/excitable dog with regards to other dogs. He is very curious to go meet other dogs, but in the very limited interactions he has had with other dogs, he seems to not have the best manners. Will try to snap at other dogs when trying to interact. He will need to be the only pet at home.\n\nHe is affectionate but not too needy. He is house trained! We are working on crate training and he is able to spend 3-4 hours in the crate throughout the day and he sleeps in the crate. Bombay Frankie can sit, paw, lay down, stay, come, and kennel.\n\nBombay Frankie would do well with an owner who has time to take him on long walks or some runs. Or in a home with a yard, he is able to run around in.",

To apply for this dog, please go to www.adoggie4you.org. Please no phone calls. Adoption fee for this dog is $200. The dog is approximately 5 years old.\n\nMy name is Chula. I used to have a daddy that was a special friend to A Doggie 4 You, but one day he sat down in his chair and we couldn't wake him up. We kept trying for several days. We were very hungry and scared. It was really hot and we didn't know what to do. Finally we heard people trying to break in. We knew we had to protect daddy, so we wouldn't let them in. We did our best, but these men in uniforms came in and put a tight noose around our necks and dragged us away. We fought hard and were very scared, especially when we were thrown in a closed truck then a scary pen that was very noisy.\n\nFinally a friend of our foster mom came to pick us up. We heard them trying to convince her to let them put us to sleep. But she said no and they loaded us up and took us to the ranch. We were really scared when we got there, even though we knew our foster mom. But we didn't trust anyone. It didn't take long for us to recognize we weren't in danger anymore. We still miss dad, but our foster mom is really nice and she says she misses dad too. The nice people here taught us how to walk on a leash, get in a kennel, and play with toys. We are really excited about finding a new family. I am sometimes a little shy around new people, but if you give me treats and are nice I warm up really fast. I love my brother Booger, but I wasn't around a lot of other dogs. I have made friends with some boy dogs I met. I would just have to get to know your other dog first. I don't like small dogs much, they are too noisy.",

My name is Moon Pie and I am a beautiful pittie/bulldog mix princess, estimated to be 6 years old and 55 pounds, who is available for adoption through Fetching Tails Foundation. I have a big personality that will keep you entertained: I am smart, funny (my piggy snorts and grunts will keep you laughing, for sure!), strong-willed and a social butterfly who loves to be around my people. I am generally laid-back and enjoy lounging around, but also have cute bursts of playful energy and would love a big toy box at my forever home so I can pick out the perfect prize with which to entertain myself. I would do best in a quieter home without kids or cats. I get along with other dogs - I can be barky when I first meet new friends (I just like to talk, what can I say?)  My favorite activities include going for long walks, playing with toys (I love squeaky ones!), sunbathing on the deck in our yard, and watching the world from my comfy dog bed by the windows or the couch.\n\nI have pretty lovely manners, as well. I\u2019m potty trained, and as a proper lady I prefer the privacy of my own yard when I need to poop. I am crate trained, as well, though I don't really need to be because I will find my favorite spot on the couch and nap until you return. When on adventures outside of the home, I am good (though a little strong) on a leash and am well-behaved during car rides since I love to look out the window as the world passes by! I am a sweet, sassy doll who would do great with a human who wants an exercise buddy for long walks (I can go about a mile a day with my foster momma!) as well as a loving, devoted companion for quiet nights at home. What are you waiting for? You know you wanna fill out that adoption application!\n\nLove,\nMoon Pie\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess. If any questions please email us!",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

He has a back issue and is missing one eye, but is otherwise healthy and he doesn\u2019t let it slow him down at all. Bruno enjoys wandering the back yard. He is a well-mannered fellow. While he gets along with other dogs, he prefers to hang with his humans. If you are looking for a velcro pug, search no more\u2026Bruno is your guy.",

She is still very shy and slow to warm up. She is always smiling and very playful with the other dogs. Prissy will require a fenced-in yard and is not able to walk on a leash at this time and not able to be touched until you earn her trust.

This is just a courtesy post. \n\nMy name is Belle. I am a spayed Red Pit and I am 1 1/2 to 2 years old. I am a happy, energetic girl with a lot of love to give. I enjoy walks and playing fetch with sticks and rope toys. I also love blankets in my crate to snuggle in. Unfortunately, I am needing a new home because my foster family lives within city limits and cannot give me the attention, love, and space I deserve. I am high energy and will do best with an active family. I would perfer to be the only dog in the home. I get nervous and agitated around small dogs especially small dogs that bark alot. I am crate and house trained but will require a fenced yard to play in. If you think you are the family for me, please do not hesitate to contact us. \n\nBelle is blind in one eye, but has been seen by a vet and was told that there would not be any long term care for her eye. From what we can gather, she was born this way.",

To inquire about me or to arrange a meeting, please email fosterdogadopt@orphansofthestorm.org\n\nI'm a fun loving boy who enjoys going into playgroup with the Rough and Rowdies! I don't mesh well with calm dogs who like their space, I just don't understand why they don't want to wrestle me! I have been in two homes and both reported that I can be protective of my home and yard. I will need an adult only home willing to work on this with me and help teach me that I don't need to protect from visitors. I'm an active young dog, very trainable, and willing to learn anything. I have started basic obedience and would love a home that continues my training. Give me a chance - I promise to try my very hardest! \n\nFrom my foster: \"Kobe is endless ENERGY.. He loves to walk, run, wrestle, chase rabbits and squirrels. He's jumpy and wants to play, so he's best with adults and older kids. He likes to mix it up with my active husky. Kobe has a big appetite and a big heart. He becomes a lap dog when relaxing in the house. And, he's a loyal companion, following me everywhere. He can sit, but needs some training to counter his extra enthusiasm... In the end, Kobe just wants to be your friend!\"",

How awesome is that? Help is a call or text away.\n\nAdopters must be willing to come to the Farm in Southern Dutchess County NY for handling lessons 2-3 times to take handling lessons to uphold her training. \n\nNot only are you adopting a fully trained dog- you receive help when needed- all questions answered promptly.\n\nWe care and back every dog that comes through our doors- for life.\n\nShe is well trained, super compliant and now needs a home to call her own.\n\nWhile Chelsea is good with kids we prefer an adult only pet free home.  She can be over aroused with toys.  \n\nApplications:\n\nwww.townandcountryk9resq.org\n\nunder contact us.\n\nQuestions: Text Christine 914-772-0649\n",

On his wish list is a home where he can sprint, maneuver and corner to fetch a tennis ball or even a large Jolly ball, with the reward of a good chomping afterward, his absolute favorite pastime. His people will understand this is an important outlet for him and be respectful in waiting until hes done with it, thank you, therefore only in moderation! He also likes water play, even just standing in a kiddie pool and splashing is quite fun. Adjustable, yes, hes just as happy hanging out quietly with his people indoors with his good manners, hes perfectly housetrained and can manage alone for a few hours while his people are out. Hes happy to alert you to your home package arrivals too, no power cord needed! Hes a loyal boy like that, quite comfortable in his own skin, never needy and doesnt require dog friends although he did live with a smaller senior female dog in his prior home. We think he tends to like being an only child, or perhaps living with a single lady dog. Meet and greets can be accommodated with advance scheduling. Sorry, felines, youre not his type! I weigh approximately 76 lbs. Click here to view my behavior notes from staff and volunteers.",

            "description": "1. What is your name?\nHi! My name is Fetty Wap!\n\n2. How old are you?\nI am around 2 years old.\n\n3. What do you look like?\nI have been told more than once that I look like Scooby Do! I am not really sure what that means, but Scooby must be one good-looking dude! I am a nice medium-sized red boy with the coolest stand-up ears you have ever seen. I have absolutely no poker face because my ears give me away every time. My eyes are sincere, almost doe-like and I am ALWAYS SMILING. I have a hilarious underbite and my lip often gets caught on my toof which makes for a comical resting face.\n\n4. What do you like to eat?\nFood, duh! I love food, I love peanut butter, I love treats, I love bananas, I love anything you offer me. I used to get in trouble because I thought I should put my mouth on everything and everything belonged in my mouth, but, not anymore! I know better now!\n\n5. What kind of personality do you have?\nHAPPY. I am always happy. ALWAYS. I am so silly, I love to goof off! I have a bunch of energy, I will do anything you ask of me and I promise to give it my all no matter what you want me to try. I am friendly to everyone I meet. I love meeting new people. I have a TON of toy drive, tug drive and a will to work. I am looking for someone to adventure with, let\u2019s go places, let\u2019s try new things, let\u2019s play, you name it, I am game. I just want to be your friend. My foster parents are so proud of me because I used to not really have any interest in people, I did such a good job entertaining myself that I didn\u2019t think people were important. But now I have seen the light, people are everything! I will love you so hard if you allow it! I am generally a very confident boy, the only time I am a little unsure is in high stress environments that are new to me, but my foster parents take me everywhere and work with me on that so I am improving every day. I can be a softie if someone is harsh to me, but I am not a scaredy cat, I have endless amounts of curiosity that keeps me motivated to explore and try things out.\n\n6. Describe your perfect day\nEvery day is a perfect day, so this is a hard one. Instead let\u2019s list things I love to do. I love to go on walks, I need my walks and I make them so much fun, you will love them just as much as I do. Wait until I show you how fun it is to roll in bushes and landscaping. Also, we can do parkour! I love to \u201cclimb\u201d onto rocks, picnic benches, playground equipment, you name it. Just point and say climb and I will try it! At home I love to chew, I can chew for hours and my foster family has it all figured out, as long as I have some of my favorite chew toy options available, I will self-entertain and stay out of trouble for hours while they watch tv or cook dinner. I love to play tug and I love to play fetch! I love to play with my small group of dog foster siblings too. Oh, and I love to train! This nice man that I live with taught me all of these things and we practice all the time, well, at least I try to get him to practice with me all of the time. My favorite part of training is when he says FREE and I get to run into his arms and get rewarded. I also love to swim! This past summer my foster mom taught me to dock dive, I am not the best at it, but I still LOVE to try! I have no fear and I know that with more practice my jumping will get much better! We have jumped at both regular swimming pools and official dog diving pools. We also LOVE to go swim in rivers and creeks, we call it \u201cgoing creeking\u201d it is so much fun!\n\n7. What is your favorite toy?\nI have a favorite indestructible chew called a goughnut and I spend hours with it every day. Even the strongest goughnut only lasts so long though, I can chew better than most. I also love moose antlers, bully sticks and frozen raw marrow bones too! I like to play fetch with the ChuckIt! Rubber balls and I also love to catch and retrieve frisbee rollers. Whoever adopts me will be supplied with all of these items so that I have the best transition possible!\n\n8. Do you know any tricks?\nYes! I sit and hold my sit very nicely until you say free! I know down, climb, come and heel as well! In addition to that I have learned to fetch. My best trick to offer though is comedic relief. I am so good at making everyone laugh. I am a weirdo and I encourage you to embrace it. These are hard times and I promise you that with me around you won\u2019t be able to feel down, I will keep you up and smiling always!\n\n9.  What scares you?\nNot much, and to most people I look completely and utterly fearless. I have been with my foster parents for a long time so they know me really well and they say that I am a little nervous in new environments, but the only way they can tell is that I am not quite as responsive to my commands as I am at home.\n\n11. Do you have any doggie best friends?\nI have a lot of dog friends! I LOVE my foster siblings, my favorite is a Dutch Shepherd named Iya. We love to wrestle! I am very playful with dogs that I know, but because of my genetics and background my foster parents are very protective of me and they only let me play with dogs that they know would be a good match for my antics. I do have a couple of very bossy female dog siblings in my house and when I get too silly or rough they really let me have it and I listen because they mean it! I have a lot of respect for them. Dogs seem to really like me, I am a likable dude.\n\n12. If you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be?\nThat is a toss-up, I would either be in my living room to chew and play with my toys next to my people or on a walk with my people.\n\n13. How is your health?\nMy health is great now! When I came in I had some health problems, I had a horrible recurring UTI that wouldn\u2019t go away, but we finally kicked it to the curb a few months ago and it never came back! Because of the poor conditions I was held in for my first few years of life I have very flat feet and splayed toes with some supination in my pasterns. My foster mom has fed me very nutritional diet and has walked me on grass, sand, gravel, hills and stairs daily since I was rescued and we have made some improvement. My flat feet don\u2019t stop me or even slow me down at all, I can still do everything normal, I will just never be a show dog or a foot model ? \n\n\n14. How long have you lived in your foster home?\nI have been with my foster family since February 2020. My foster parents were dedicated to giving me all of the time and training I needed before placing me for adoption, we all agree that I am now totally ready for a family of my own! \n\n15. Who do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest            companion? \nI live with my foster parents (my foster dad is a trainer) and their 2 human children (6 and 8 years old). I have lots of foster brother and sister dogs, it\u2019s always a full house here.\n\n16. Where do you hang out when you are home alone?\nWhen my foster parents are not home, I am in my crate. I am perfectly crate trained and I do great at relaxing in my crate. I also sleep in my crate every night. I am quiet and sleep through the night with no issue!\n\n18. What do you love about your foster family?\nI love that they love me and aren\u2019t in a rush to push me out. They put their all into me and they are 100% dedicated in finding me the perfect home. They taught me how to dog, I really had no idea what I was or what I should do when I was rescued, I was lost and needed a lot of direction.\n\n19. What was life like before you were rescued by Even Chance and         brought into the welcoming arms of your foster parents?\nI was rescued by the ASPCA from a NY dogfighting raid. I was one of about 30 dogs that were confiscated. I was raised in a small box in a NY basement, I really had no idea about any of the world outside of that basement. The ASPCA got me to a temporary shelter but soon reached out to Even Chance because they realized I needed some special attention and training. \n\n\nClosing lines: Even Chance does not operate on a first come, first serve basis. In most cases we have already decided the type of home and owner we want for our dogs. These opinions are based on the temperament tests we perform prior to accepting the dog into our program and the behaviors the dogs display as they spend time in our homes. Our agency reserves the right to deny acceptance of any dog to an owner who we feel the lifestyle does not match that of the dog. We are in no way judging you or your lifestyle; we simply want to put our dogs in the best living situation possible. We take very seriously the decision we make when it comes to placing one of our dogs in a forever home. If I sound like the perfect pit bull for your and your family and you are interested in giving me a forever home, do not hesitate! Please fill out an application here and my foster family will contact you to schedule an in-person meet and greet. We look forward to meeting any and all interested applicants. \n",

I'm SUPER FRIENDLY, LOVING and JUST A BIG SILLY GOOFY GIRL.  I'm fine with dogs in passing on walks but have not been super socialized and best if I'm a SOLO DOG. Also I'm not fond of cats and because of my size it's best if I go with kids ages 14 yrs+.  I know basic commands, am housebroken and crate trained. I could use some more leash training as I do pull a bit still. I'm medium active but do get a burst of energy and do the zoomies. I am a GREAT RUNNING DOG and I'll run right next to you and afterwards I'm just a pile of mush on the couch. I'm a BIG SNUGGLE BUG and have to lay next to you or on you on the couch and bed. My only vice is that I'm \"food funny\" with the bowl of food and will guard it and also guard certain objects like: Balls.. but it's all trainable/manageable if you are willing to work with me on this and I do come with a trainer if you adopt me!! If you want a BIG LOVE and a BFF for life! Please come meet me today!\n\nFor more info/application - pls email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

She was put on antibiotics .( cleared up)\nWe took her to the eye dr and it was determined she has slight dry eye so a drop of Tachrolimus must be put in both eyes daily.\nEVERYTHING was addressed by us as obviously she was let down by her past owners.\nIt is so hard to believe that this absolute sweetheart of a dog who is great with people , kids and other dogs was so let down in this world.\n\nShe comes with one month Free Pet Insurance by Trupanion.\nAlso, a go home Goodie bag includes: grain free food, treats, toys, bowls, toys, shampoo, lead , collar, measuring cup,etc\nThere is an application process, we call you Veterinarians ( you must have 5 years of previous history of caring for a pet) and a home check.\nONLY Broward & Palm Bch Counties can apply at this time.\nPlease, call us for more info or for an application. 954-588-7045\n\n",

            "description": "This beautiful girl is a Belgian Malinois.   Arrow is the total package of beauty and brains.  She is about 15 months old and a very active, playful and loving dog.\nArrow lives with three other dogs in her current foster home.  She loves to play, and would prefer to live with a large, active male dog(s) in her permanent home.\nIf you are not familiar with the Belgian Malinois breed, please take time to educate yourself :\n https://www.woofproject.org/malinois-breed\n\nThey are fantastic dogs but not for everyone and not for the novice dog owner.\nMore specifically, for Arrow:\n\u2022 NO apartments, condos, townhomes or shared living situations\n\u2022 A six foot fence is REQUIRED.  Malinois are known for scaling or jumping fences \u2013 they are great athletes\n\u2022 You must lead an active lifestyle.  She gets 5+ miles of walking daily in her foster home plus lots of play time daily with her canine companions\n\u2022 She loves to play ball and frisbee\n\u2022 This is not a dog who will be happy being at home by herself during the day.  She would be better with someone who works from home or can take her to work with them.\n\u2022 Her house manners are impeccable.  She is housebroken and has never chewed inappropriately.  She does prefer to be allowed on the couch and human bed, but will stay off if you insist.\n\u2022 We are recommending a home with NO kids and NO small animals.  She lives with older kids in her current foster home and that might be a possibility.\n\u2022 She would be fantastic for an adopter interested in competitive canine sports or obedience.  She is super smart, easy to train, and a phenomenal athlete.  These are all characteristics of the breed.  The breed does demand training, and experienced handlers.  \n\u2022 Experienced homes only please.  It is a requirement that you have experience owning a guarding or working breed canine.\n\u2022 Arrow showed some signs of anxiety when she first arrived in her foster home, but settled in in a matter of days.   Her current foster family will work with her permanent family to transition her to her new home gradually and set her up for success.\nThis is a very special girl who will steal your heart.  Are you the right forever home for her?\n \n\nIf you would like to adopt Arrow, please visit our website and apply today!\n\nhttps://www.washingtongsd.org/adopt\n\nPlease note that we do require a secure fenced yard.\n\nOur hours are by appointment only. IF WE FIND YOU TO BE A GOOD MATCH YOU WILL BE CONTACTED typically within 72 hours. YOU WILL HEAR FROM US ONLY IF WE FIND YOU TO BE A GOOD MATCH FOR ONE OF OUR FOSTERS AND OUR ADOPTION GUIDELINES/PROGRAM. WE MUST REVIEW A COMPLETED APPLICATION BEFORE A POSSIBLE APPOINTMENT IS ARRANGED. NO EXCEPTIONS. All visits with the puppies/dogs are by approved applications and appointments only.\n\n*************** We reserve the right to refuse any adoption without justification and not all applications or inquiries may receive a response. ***************\n\n\n",

Long walks, a big fenced in yard and car rides are my favorite!  \n\nI like other dogs and am a big, goofy boy at heart.  I would enjoy a dog friend in my forever home that would like to run and play with me.  \n\nFoster mom says I\u2019m a polite boy and my manners are impeccable!  One of my favorite pastimes right before bed is when my human rubs and scratches my head.  It makes me feel calm and content.  \n \nSometimes I am shy with new people.  If you are patient with me, I promise to show you my amazing personality that I just  know will win your heart over. \n\nApply online at rescueapittie.org to adopt me!",

He is a goofy boy full of personality and expression. Marley is a bit socially awkward and doesn't understand what communication is okay and what is not but out trainer and and his foster mom are working with him to learn the difference. 90% of the time he is cuddly, playful and wants all the attention but at times does not want to be messed with and during those times, his foster just leaves him alone or brings out the Frisbee and he is happy as can be again. Marley would do best in a home who has dog experience and will continue on his training plan as it seems to really be helping him! Marley would also do great with another active dog his size to play with! \n\nIf adventure is your forte, Marley here might be the perfect buddy to tag along!",

She is very treat-motivated, very house-trained and LOVES to go on walks with her harness; she even checks in with her handler! She needs time and space to get comfortable when she meets new people, but she loves her human friends and forms deep bonds once she gets to know someone. During her time at the shelter, she has quickly become a staff and volunteer favorite. Her ideal home would be low traffic with a yard and slow, proper intros when there are visitors. She has the potential to live with another pup, as long as they respect her boundaries and give her time to get comfortable with them. As with all our pups, Molly will go home with our ongoing support, as well as a training voucher from Friends of Austin Animal Center. She has such a great personality and will make a wonderful loyal friend to a respectful owner who will allow her to go at her own pace. I weigh approximately 66 lbs.

But luckily for him, he also has a big team of people working with him to become more confident, and to show him that we are there to help him and to love him. With proper intros, Ace is making friends left and right! If you are wondering, proper intros for Ace means no direct eye contact, speaking softly, offering treats, and letting him approach you. It can take some time for that tail to become untucked and that's okay. You can't rush this kind of thing. You know when you have Ace's seal of approval because he will show you his naughty side! We diligently redirect him and he is learning quickly what kind of behavior gets rewarded. And who doesn't love rewards?! You may also get some nibbly kisses once he really feels comfortable with you. According to his surrender notes, Ace is house trained, crate trained, and has lived with another dog. He is afraid of lawn mowers but loves car rides, squeaky toys, and tug of war. His notes also say, He barks when he sees someone. Then hides. He watches them for a little bit and then loves them. We love you, too, Ace. So much. I weigh approximately 69 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

I will show you how to play fetch with them too. Did I mention I like to play fetch?\n\nAnyway, Im a five year old country boy that likes to do hound things. My foster mom says Im too smart for my britches but thats just silly because I dont have any britches. I like to keep busy so I could use a home that understands my hound ways. Im a talker too and though my foster mom says hound people like talkers, maybe your neighbors wont so probably a country home would be best for me. I like to take off after critter so Im not looking to live with cats. Im an independent chill kind of guy, although I'd like to be the only dog in your home. Even though the rescue ladies swoon over me as I am, I am slimming down now that I am taking thyroid medicine, which I will have to take for the rest of my life. Im an indoor dog and have good house manners but I can get carried away and jump around when I see a toy so I may be too much for small kids. I got a hounds heart of gold and would love to be your best friend and play fetch. I'll even teach you like I taught my foster mom. Did I mention I like to play fetch? And toys. Im crazy about toys.\n\nYou can learn more about me and apply to adopt me at www.rescuedohio.org.",

He came to Just Cause Rescue when he was found injured in Biloxi with wounds and a broken leg that had healed on its own.\n-In his foster home Cadette has loved to be around other dogs, he can play a little rough with small dogs but with guidance that should get better.  He is just happy to be in a home!\n-Kennel trained, he enjoys his kennel for security since he can be kind of shy at first.\n-House training is going well, he is having fewer and fewer accidents.\n-Loves treats so he will learn commands quickly since he is food motivated.  He will let you pet him and take his food bowl so no food aggression with his foster people.\n-While he is shy he is opening up quickly and now enjoys kisses on his head!\n-Cadette walks great on a leash and is learning that going in the house is fun, we really believe he lived outside his whole life.\n-He is still a young guy that needs to play to burn off his energy and be worked with commands, he will nibble your toes but he is learning they aren\u2019t toys!\n-While we do not know what this young guys past was like, we do know he is a happy guy so thankful to be off the streets and being taught what it is like to be a spoiled dog now!",

She is spayed & is in overall good health with no concerns. \n\nBehaviorally, Prada is an energetic and very playful pittie who loves to run, fetch and follow her people throughout her home to keep them happy company. She has lived with and socialized with small children, as well as several other dogs and has done great with everyone.  She is particularly fond of small children, even small babies, & will sometimes become protective of them if there are non-family members around.  It is extremely clear that her intent is to protect the little humans in her life that she adores, however she needs a family who's lifestyle is fitting for her. Prada is fully house trained and is also doing great with her crate training. She has been through so much so quickly & is ready for her forever family to put an end to all her changes and give her a new home.\n\nPlease apply for Prada at the link below!\n\nhttps://pitofoursoulsrescue.com/our-dogs/adoption-application/",

When we met her at the shelter, she didn't even bark for attention. She was a good, quiet little lady. Patiently awaiting her ticket out of the shelter. She is a total leaner and loves to put her head on your lap for pets. She is a superstar! She adores people and bonds quickly to them. While she is great with people, she needs a home where she is the only dog. \n\nCeto does have hip dysplasia and her weak backend means she is unable to jump and should avoid stairs. She is looking for a home without stairs and would prefer less strenuous hikes. She can do daily walks but is limited and does need help getting into a car. \n\nShe does like toys like balls, loving to chew and rip them apart. She also loves to hide bones but doesn't dig in the yard. She may get into trash cans and her favorite spot is on the couch. \n\nCeto follows people around and is oh so sweet. She demands pets and doesn't like when you stop. She cannot receive enough love. \n\nShe came to us from Salinas Animal Services.",

Once we pulled him from the shelter we sought out some professional training for him.  The training went well; however, he had a little setback when transported to Oregon.  He has since bonded tremendously with his foster and loves to play with other foster dogs.  We are not sure how seamless his transition to a forever home will be but we intend on being a part of that transition as needed.  He will require lots of patience and understanding of what he has been through.  He will need a relatively quiet environment.  May even do best with a single owner home.  He does not like raised voices or fast moving arms in a motion of swinging at or near him.  He is a super sweet boy once he starts to trust his human.  Seeks out pets and love.  Even a bit playful when he is relaxed.  Please don't let his past influence what his future can be.  He truly is a good boy with a bad start.  He is neutered, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. \n\nPlease contact us if you are interested in adopting, or even fostering, one of our dogs. We are a federal non-profit rescue. We do require a completed application and a home visit prior to adopting. Please go to our website at www.theheartofrescue.org to complete an application or call 541-782-THOR (8467).",

            "description": "DOB: 11/13/16\n\nSweet Hannah spent the first 6 months of her life living in a back yard with her 5 siblings where they never got to experience the warmth of a humans touch. From there she was taken in by a wonderful rescue but unfortunately, with their limited resources she and her siblings still rarely experienced human interactions. Hannah came to ROAR back in January with her friend Judd and has been with us ever since. She has made progress since arriving, however, she still has a long journey ahead of her. She needs someone who has the patience, experience, dedication, and determination to teach this sweet girl that the world and people are safe. Since Hannah is so fearful of the world around her she would do best in a quiet and calm environment. Hannah also requires another dog in the home to show her the ropes as well as a fenced in yard.\n\n\nHannah is up to date on vaccinations, is micro-chipped, and is spayed. \nAdoption fee is $350.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about miss Hannah please email the Adoption Coordinator at adopt.roar@gmail.com or call the shelter at 203-438-0158\n\n**For more information regarding ROAR\u2019s adoption policies and procedures, please visit our website at roar-ridgefield.org and select the \u2018adopt\u2019 tab on the home page. ROAR does not accept online applications. All applications must be filled out at the shelter.",

I am fully vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed. I am housebroken and good with children!

            "description": "This handsome guy is about 1.5 years old, 58 lbs and came to us as a stray. It\u2019s clear that Robbie was not socialized properly as a pup. He gets very overstimulated when meeting people for the first time and can be a bit intimidating while doing so. Once you get past the initial meeting and he learns you are safe, Robbie is such a wonderful dog. He loves to run and play and get pets! He is a fence fighter, another sign of over-stimulation - meaning he tends to run up and down the fence or other boundary marker barking at passers by. He would do best in a calm, Chow savvy home with structure, continued training, consistency, and no children. Robbie is being fostered about a half hour north of Houston.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an application @ https://form.jotform.us/41173109602142. Once approved, home visit and reference checks are also required.\n\nIf you have further questions outside of this listing, please email chowmail.hccc@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Slater will be arriving at his Mississippi foster home tomorrow and we can't wait to see him blossom! Thanks to Changing 42 Animal Rescue, he is looking and feeling much better than he was when he was first found as a stray in Alabama. He is incredibly shy but very sweet and will gently nudge you for attention. He is good with other dogs. Slater still needs some routine vetting and needs to be neutered so he will not be available for adoption for a couple of weeks. We would also like to get to know him a little better, as well. Please check back for updates on this beautiful boy!!UPDATE 5/8: Slater is doing fabulous in his Mississippi foster home. He saw the vet and is scheduled to be neutered on Monday. He did test very low heartworm positive so he started on preventative and medications and will be retested soon. He loves his skin foster brother and mom but he seems to be very frightened of men. He also seems to have some discomfort when walking and wearing a collar but does great with a harness on, likely due to the injury/sores on his neck that are freshly healed.7/30 UPDATE: Slater was retested for heartworm disease and retested as very light positive. We have decided to continue with medications for slow-kill treatment and he will need to be retested in a few months.",

            "description": "Parker is such a handsome boy. He is around 3 years old. He does great on a leash and likes to get outside for walks. He even more loves to have a big fenced in property of some kind. That is what we are looking for for this big boy. He does well with other dogs and loves to run with them. It is a no go for cats. We put no kids but as long as they are older and understand he wants his space (he is not one to be hugged or overly loved on). He likes his pets and that is about it. He is a high strung, busy dog that would love a big yard or farm to be as active as he wants to be. PLEASE READ BELOW FOR UPDATES.\n\nPUPDATE 6/1/20 - Parker went to a home for about a week and it was very clear that he was meant to be an outside dog. He just loves to be outside and would love to be on a farm. He would need a fenced in area or an electric fence, because who doesn't love to follow smells? Otherwise, he is a wonderful companion. He would just prefer to be working and busy.  He won't be a cuddly house dog.\n\nPUPDATE 8/8/2020 - Parker is being removed from PetFinder to take some time to work with his anxiety.\n\nPUPDATE 11/5/20 - Parker has been being exercised more and also started some anti-anxiety medication for the past few months. He is doing wonderful now that we have figured out his dose. This is something that he would need to continue to stay on daily and your vet can order it through your pharmacy. It is only around $25 a month.",

We are excited to let everyone know that Mello is officially up for adoption!  Mello came to us in February and required immediate spinal surgery to fix a herniated disc but is all healed up and doing great!  He is a master of the naps!  Mello truly lives up to his name; he is one chill dude.  He would, if he could, cuddle and get belly rubs all day.  Sounds like a pretty good day, right?  Mello has exhibited some separation anxiety, so he would do best in a home where someone is with him most of the time.  He loves car rides so would be happy running some errands in between belly rub sessions.  In addition, while we have been working on his confidence around other dogs, we think he would do best in a home without other animals.  He has gone from being reactive around other dogs to being able to be walked on leash by them without much of a reaction but, this work will need to be continued so he is able to gain more confidence and be a good boy around potential dog friends.  He is a smart kid and knows sit, down, place, stay and wait.  Smarty pants!  He has spent some time being crate trained, too, but he isn\u2019t super keen on it and would prefer to not have to spend a lot of time in it and, if used, will need additional training to be comfortable.  In general, Mello has come a long way with us but, will need someone who is willing to continue to work with him, help him build confidence and be his forever snuggle buddy.  He loves to play fetch and rolling around in the grass so we think a yard would be pretty awesome for him.  He also loves kids!  And, his favorite game is hide and seek. Adorable!  \n \nIf you are up for belly rubs, snuggles and hide and seek, please fill out an application which can be found at our website, www.forgottendogsrescue.com. We estimate Mello was born around 2012, so he's an older guy,  and weighs about 70 pounds.  Mello\u2019s adoption fee is $350 and he is neutered, microchipped and up to date on appropriate vaccines.",

The rescue has tried to find them individual homes but it has never worked out. They need a canine companion, preferably each other, and someone that is home 99% of the time.\n\nThey were adopted as pups into a home with a stay at home mom and had a fenced yard so they were not leash trained. They had each other and never had to be crated. Well time passed, and family dynamics changed and resulted in a move. The new residence could not accommodate the boys so they came into the rescue. They have so much love to give to a family looking for companionship.  He has been described as the perfect dog by a family that did a trial adoption but was unable to be home enough to meet his needs.  He is completely vetted and his adoption fee is $200",

WE have had his entropian eyes repaired and that bad tooth removed. Fang is now ready for a forever home. He's very much a typical husky with a love for people and other dogs, and a mischievous bend. He will need an experienced home because he has a tendency to be a Houdini. Aside from that he's incredibly tolerant of even grouchy dogs, and small children. He deserves a home with an active family who can take him for runs and play sessions. He is potty trained, does pretty well on the leash, and doesn't destroy big things like furniture- books and shoes should not be within his grasp however! Just added!!\nBrittni Marie\n\nGet Heeled Dog Training\nwill donate a virtual training session to his new adopted family!\n\nFang needs a family who is around or a dog friend to play with",

She came into rescue with significant trauma to her eyes and head, she was depressed, terrified and clearly endured abuse.\n\nWe couldn't save Betty's eyes but we have done everything we can to repair her heart and teach her that the world isn't such a bad place and not every human is cruel. She's come leaps and bounds with her rehab and shes ready to find a foster home to continue to learn and grow.\n\nBetty is crate trained, its her safe place. She enjoys going on walks but is a slow walker and reactive to other dogs on walks. She LOVES to roll in the grass, its her favorite! Betty needs to be the only pet in the home because of her past trauma and she deserves to be the queen of the castle. She does not prefer small children, or men. A man can live in the home but she needs to have her main handler be female, we do however believe over time she will warm up to a kind man. Betty is in general low matinence once she learns the ;layout of the home. \n\nShe loves to cuddle and play, she loves treats and has just discovered toys are awesome! Whoever wins this girl over will have the most loyal friend anyone could have. \n\nIf interested in our special girl, please submit an application.\nwww.animalhelpalliance.org\n \n\n \n\n",

We scooped him up and off to the neurologist who said it was orthopedic.... off to the specialty surgeon. Surgeon finds that he has a dislocation in his pelvis, an old fracture that cannot be repaired, the leg had to come off (to relieve pain)... then it is found that he also has IVDD... so the disc is also repaired. Because both injuries were old, he has not regained full use of the one back leg so he has a cart that he LOVES!\n\nBecause of his condition, Finley does need to be expressed to go potty. Finley doesn't want to let this scare you off - It is SUPER easy to learn which means I go potty on your schedule! Check out our very own Dr. Wong at Southeast Veterinary Neurology, who did my surgery, teach you how to express a dog!\n\nWe have medically done all we can for this happy boy. No pain and all parts working as well as they can making a super sweet little boy who is easy to take care of, get along with dogs and kids, and a\n\nll he needs now is a family of his own.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please complete the DRSF Online Adoption form.My adoption fee covers all my (prior) vet care (adopter receives vet records).

            "description": "Ozzy is a 5 year old 13 pound male chiweenie\n\nHe is a sweet sweet boy, and earned his name as his transporter was listening to some classic rock on the way to Miami, Ozzy was singing along, and his transporter decided he was \"barking at the moon\" and thus he had his new name!\n\nOzzy was brought to a local shelter back at the beginning of July, his owners brought him there to be euthanized because he was paralyzed in his hind end. The shelter asked for help and here he is! Ozzy gets around great with and without his amazing cart and does need to be expressed, but that's super easy to learn.\n\nBecause of his injury, Ozzy does need to be expressed to go potty. He doesn't want to let this scare you off - It is SUPER easy to learn which means he goes potty on your schedule- no sniffing around or waiting! Check out our very own Dr. Wong at Southeast Veterinary Neurology, who examined me, teach you how to express a dog!\n\nFrom Ozzy:\n\nI am Sir Speedy, and I've got a great set of wheels! My foster mom will tell you that I'm always on the go and up for a run around the yard, a romp with my dog friends (my current companions are cart drivers just like me) or a nice, long stroll around the neighborhood. Once I get to know you, I will shower you with kisses. I do like to use my voice, so expect to hear me announce visitors and bark when meeting new friends-be they human or canine. Best feature? Well, just look at my photo. As my foster mom says, \"One look at those perky ears, and you can't help but fall in love!\"\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please complete the DRSF Online Adoption form.My adoption fee covers all my (prior) vet care (adopter receives vet records).

He can get up and take a few steps and he can go to the bathroom himself with only occasional assistance. He asks to go outside and if he can't get there, he goes on a pee pad.\n\nHe's good with kids, adults and other dogs. He LOVES toys and snuggling near people (head on feet if at all possible).\nHe's a super sweet boy who needs very little extra care.\n\nHansel:\n\nI'm a master blanket burrower! Although my back legs don't work, I can climb into bed and wiggle myself under the covers so that I am fully covered with just the tip of my snout sticking out. My sniffer monitors my surroundings; I can detect a duck outside and give him the barking business without ever leaving the comfort of my bed.\n\nYou need not feel sorry for this IVDD survivor; I can outrun my housemates when the food bowl comes out! Speaking of suppertime, it's a good idea to feed me separately. I'm such a foodie, I tend to get testy when I sense competition. You should know that I am rather vocal; I'll bark when someone is at the door, when meeting new dogs and people (although I like everyone I meet) and, of course, when I see/smell those ducks!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please complete the DRSF Online Adoption form.My adoption fee covers all my (prior) vet care (adopter receives vet records).

Donald is somewhat of a special needs pup. When Donald came into the shelter he was not walking normal. We took Donald to the vet and found out he has luxating patellas (meaning his knee's pop in and out). Most dogs will go their life without needing surgical intervention. Because Donald is young, our vet recommended keeping him on joint supplements. Please consider giving this sweet pup the home he truly deserves. Donald is neutered, heartworm negative, microchipped, dewormed, vaccinated and flea treated. Donald's adoption fee is $200.

A little bit of fetch here, a little bit of running around the yard there, and a whole lot of cuddling up in between makes every day with Chucho just as great as the last! This handsome boy is exactly what you need to brighten up your home with a big pitty grin. Chucho loves to play in the backyard, rolling around in the grass and people watching from afar. Even inside Chucho loves to play around with his toys, shaking them everywhere and enjoying a bit of catch with his treats. Chucho has learned it's just as important to enjoy the downtime as well. He's a world-class cuddler who's sure to let you know when it's time for some attention with cute noises and endless excitement. And if you're still asleep? He's sure to nuzzle up to you for some belly rubs. Chucho is sure to be a bright spot in any home but would do best in a semi-active family with a backyard. Due to a minor leg limp, he'll require a bit of extra care so as not to aggravate it by enjoying too much playtime. But you'll easily forget when you see his sweet brown eyes and trademark big grin in your day! Come see this handsome boy today!",

            "description": "ROCKY is a male Lab/Boxer about 4 1/2 years old. Rocky is a happy guy with energy to spare! He would be best suited for an active person who will include him in lots of activities, walks and play time. Rocky loves the kiddie pool and water from the hose in the warm weather and loves the snow in the winter too! He does, however, not like the cold! :) He will snuggle all up in his warm blankets and chew on his favorite treat - a Greenie - when he comes in from the cold outside ! Rocky also wears a coat now that the really cold weather has come. (see above - what a handsome guy!!) We recommend no young children, as Rocky would be too active for them and can get overly enthusiastic when running and playing. He also has a tendency to sometimes pull on/grab the leash. He will need someone who can work on/with this. Training is recommended, but Rocky will learn quickly. He is a smart boy! Using a martingale collar and easy-walk harness makes walking him much easier and much more enjoyable for both of you. An apartment would not be suitable - Rocky is looking for a home with a fenced yard where he can run and play! Rocky would prefer a home with no cats and would be happiest as the only dog in the home",

Please note: L.A. and Orange Counties are out of area due to traffic/drive time.\nFree at last, male Rogue and female Monroe were rescued from living in a small outdoor kennel together since they were puppies (approximately 7 years!). They've been at the rescue about 6 months and they are now about 8 years old. Rogue is a Mastiff/Pitbull Mix who is mostly black with a little white on chest and weighs about 77 pounds. Black/white Pitbull mix Monroe weighs 55 pounds. They only had each other for a long time and are very attached to each other.  They are looking for a good home together where they will be part of the family. Rogue is very sweet, cute and puppy-like.  Rogue is a very likable, good boy and knows to shake his paw.   Monroe is a happy, active, inquisitive, playful dog who is very sweet and loving. Rogue and Monroe have good temperaments and look and act young. They know to sit for food and treats.  They're friendly and good on a leash on walks and in public. They are house and crate trained. Considering their past, they are very nice dogs who are starved for attention, just want to be loved and be with their family. Also due to their past, they are a bit undersocialized with other dogs and will need proper introductions with other dogs. We recommend their new potential adopter be an experienced dog owner who has experience with this type of dog. Their new home should have a secure fenced yard and no small dogs or cats in the household.  Rogue and Monroe are healthy and have been spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed and microchipped. They are ready and waiting to go to their new loving home.\n\n$150 adoption fee for both, cash only, which is to help reimburse for a portion of expenses of dog rescue and rehabilitation. Adoption contract required. We deliver adopted pets to their new home to see where they will be living. \n\n$150 adoption fee for both, cash only, which is to help reimburse for a portion of expenses of dog rescue and rehabilitation. Adoption contract required. We are looking for adopters who are willing and able to care for this dog for its lifetime (10+ years). Location: Quail Valley/Menifee, Southwest Riverside County. Local adoptions only; within 75 mile radius because we deliver animal to its new home to do a home/yard check. Please note: L.A. and Orange Counties are out of area because of traffic and difficult, time-consuming drive.) We prescreen potential adopters before setting up a meeting.\n.\nIf interested in this dog, please tell us a little about you, your family, your lifestyle, your other pets, your experience as a dog owner (which breed, etc.), where you live (which city in a home or apt) and what you are looking for in a dog. Thank you.\n\nOur adoption process involves meeting the animal by appointment.We have the best interest of the animal in mind and our goal is to find a good, permanent home for each of our rescued animals.  We have the right to decline an application if we feel it is not a good match/fit or suitable home. If you like the animal and we both feel it is a good match, an application and adoption contract is completed.  A convenient day/time is arranged for us to deliver the animal to its new home to do a home/yard check (to make sure the home and yard is safe and secure). We will collect the adoption fee (cash only) when we deliver the animal to its new home.  All our adoptions are on a trial basis because our goal is to have a successful adoption where the animal has a good permanent home and never ends up in a bad situation again.  We ask that you give the animal a chance to adjust and settle in his new home and environment.  Going to a new home with new people and a new environment is traumatic and stressful.  It will take time for the animal to become comfortable around you and his/her new home. This should be a bonding period where you get to know the animal and connect with it, spend time with it and take things slow.  He/she will need to get to know and trust you and learn the rules of the house and what is expected of him/her. This takes time, sometimes 2-3 weeks.  During this time we will hold the adoption fee and if the adoption is not working out, we ask that you contact us and return the animal and we will refund your adoption fee.\n",

Please note: L.A. and Orange Counties are out of area due to traffic/drive time.\nFree at last, male Rogue and female Monroe were rescued from living in a small outdoor kennel together since they were puppies (approximately 7 years!). They've been at the rescue about 6 months and they are now about 8 years old. Rogue is a Mastiff/Pitbull Mix who is mostly black with a little white on chest and weighs about 77 pounds. Black/white Pitbull mix Monroe weighs 55 pounds. They only had each other for a long time and are very attached to each other.  They are looking for a good home together where they will be part of the family. Rogue is very sweet, cute and puppy-like.  Rogue is a very likable, good boy and knows to shake his paw.   Monroe is a happy, active, inquisitive, playful dog who is very sweet and loving. Rogue and Monroe have good temperaments and look and act young. They know to sit for food and treats.  They're friendly and good on a leash on walks and in public. They are house and crate trained. Considering their past, they are very nice dogs who are starved for attention, just want to be loved and be with their family. Also due to their past, they are a bit undersocialized with other dogs and will need proper introductions with other dogs. We recommend their new potential adopter be an experienced dog owner who has experience with this type of dog. Their new home should have a secure fenced yard and no small dogs or cats in the household.  Rogue and Monroe are healthy and have been spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed and microchipped. They are ready and waiting to go to their new loving home.\n\n$150 adoption fee for both, cash only, which is to help reimburse for a portion of expenses of dog rescue and rehabilitation. Adoption contract required. We deliver adopted pets to their new home to see where they will be living. \n\n$150 adoption fee for both, cash only, which is to help reimburse for a portion of expenses of dog rescue and rehabilitation. Adoption contract required. We are looking for adopters who are willing and able to care for this dog for its lifetime (10+ years). Location: Quail Valley/Menifee, Southwest Riverside County. Local adoptions only; within 75 mile radius because we deliver animal to its new home to do a home/yard check. Please note: L.A. and Orange Counties are out of area because of traffic and difficult, time-consuming drive.) We prescreen potential adopters before setting up a meeting.\n.\nIf interested in this dog, please tell us a little about you, your family, your lifestyle, your other pets, your experience as a dog owner (which breed, etc.), where you live (which city in a home or apt) and what you are looking for in a dog. Thank you.\n\nOur adoption process involves meeting the animal by appointment.We have the best interest of the animal in mind and our goal is to find a good, permanent home for each of our rescued animals.  We have the right to decline an application if we feel it is not a good match/fit or suitable home. If you like the animal and we both feel it is a good match, an application and adoption contract is completed.  A convenient day/time is arranged for us to deliver the animal to its new home to do a home/yard check (to make sure the home and yard is safe and secure). We will collect the adoption fee (cash only) when we deliver the animal to its new home.  All our adoptions are on a trial basis because our goal is to have a successful adoption where the animal has a good permanent home and never ends up in a bad situation again.  We ask that you give the animal a chance to adjust and settle in his new home and environment.  Going to a new home with new people and a new environment is traumatic and stressful.  It will take time for the animal to become comfortable around you and his/her new home. This should be a bonding period where you get to know the animal and connect with it, spend time with it and take things slow.  He/she will need to get to know and trust you and learn the rules of the house and what is expected of him/her. This takes time, sometimes 2-3 weeks.  During this time we will hold the adoption fee and if the adoption is not working out, we ask that you contact us and return the animal and we will refund your adoption fee.\n",

He is a goof ball, and loves to put on a big ol smile, teeth, tongue and all! If you want a dog that is going to make you laugh every single day, this is your guy! He likes to chew up toys so he would need some tough toys that make him work for it! Kane is a total ladies man, and really only warms up to ladies! He has a really hard time trusting men so it would be best for Kane to go to a home that has no men. Kane is a big boy, and he can break out of a crate if he wants to, so he needs a strong crate that he cant break out of!",

This has not prevented this 3yr old Lab mix from being a loving dog though!! Once rescued he flourished into the sweet boy you see today. He enjoys car rides and hikes and walks very well on a leash. He is housebroken and loves his crate, he will go in on his own for a nap. Teddy does require a home with no other dogs as he was never properly socialized. He is ok with cats. Children over 10yrs old would be best due to his size. Teddy requires at least a 5 ft high fence.",

He can be timid with strangers and is said to be protective of his home. Solomon is super smart and knows all kinds of tricks...'sit,' 'shake,' 'down,' and 'roll-over.' He is treat-motivated (he takes them gently) and treats are a great way to win his trust. He would probably do best in a quieter home where there isn't a lot of foot traffic. He seems to like other dogs and is still quiet playful for an 8-year-old larger guy.

            "description": "Archer is a four year old male pit mix. He is a solid boy, weighing around 90 lbs. This guy is a total goof and, since coming into our care from a partner shelter where he tested positive for heartworm, his playful side has really started to show. Archer does need a firm owner that won\u2019t let him get away with behaviors like occasional jumping and leash grabbing. With consistency, he has shown us he already knows some basic commands like sit. He is a gentle treat taker. Due to the jumping, Archer would probably do best in a home with older or no children. He also needs a home without other dogs, but what other dog could you need besides Archer? If you agree, apply to adopt online at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

Marilyn has been in a foster home for four months and is learning to trust people. She needs a securely fenced yard and a doggy door so she can come and go. She will not go through a doorway if a person is near it. She will not come when she is called, but she wants to be with the pack. Marilyn plays with her canine foster siblings and follows them and her foster mom everywhere they go. She will let you pet her but still backs away first as if she will be struck. She feels safe in two spots in her foster home and will only sit and lie down in those two spots. If you would like to provide the special home that Marilyn needs, please complete our adoption application. Her adoption fee is $175 and includes age appropriate vaccines, spay and a microchip \n\nhttps://toolkit.rescuegroups.org/of/f?c=DMBCNVST",

He's very handsome with a big melon head, and will be an excellent couch buddy. He's about 3 1/2 years old, about 45 lbs now, and has a glossy all black short coat. What a handsome goofy boy ! He loves people, but he's too active for very small children. He's good with non-aggressive dogs, and loves his doggy girlfriends. He had a rough start in life, but he's back on track now. He's filled out, gained his muscle tone and is very athletic. He'd be a great agility dog and/or running buddy. He's all vetted, healthy and ready for his new home. He'd love to go to obedience school and learn to walk properly on a leash, but he's very smart and will learn quickly. He needs a securely fenced yard for exercise and play. He loves life, enjoys his food, and he's very playful with toys, balls and beef bones. He will be an excellent companion for some lucky humans. Please contact Dee at K9RescueVa@gmail.com with any questions, and to schedule a meeting with this sweet boy.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES! FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL ADOPT@MUTTLOVERESCUE.ORG.\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/muttloverescue\nFollow us on Twitter: @Muttlove_Rescue",

He is about a year old and eager to please and will do almost anything for a treat.  He was attacked by another dog recently and is healing up well and will be ready for his forever very soon. He would probably be best as an only pet.  He loves people but can be a little jealous and does not like to share his people with others sometimes.  He was previously an outside dog but is adapting really well to being inside and LOVES being on the couch with you.  He hasn't has a single accident in his crate and understands to go outside to potty.  He likes to jump up and hug so would be best with older kids but we are working on this.",

Sadly, Prissy had health issues and passed away earlier this year so now Buddy is looking for his forever family alone. Buddy is a senior and is the sweetest boy. He loves to cuddle and be close to his person. He is quiet and seldom barks. Buddy is house trained and will take himself out of the doggy door to do his business. He is crate trained but doesn't require crating when his foster parents are away from the home. He is not destructive and doesn't chew. Buddy loves plush toys with squeakers and enjoys treats of all kind. He gets along with the dogs in his foster home and enjoys spending time in the yard. It is not known how Buddy does with cats but he does enjoy attention from older, gentle children. One of the reasons that Buddy's former family did reach out to rescue for help is because Buddy has seizure disorder and they were worried about managing his condition. Buddy's seizures are currently very well controlled with CBD oil but have also been well managed with phenobarbital. Buddy is very healthy otherwise. Buddy is a loving boy and deserves to have a family of his own. Giving him daily medication for his condition is such a small thing to ask for all of the love that Buddy will give in return.",

She had a microchip and when the shelter reached out to her owner Maddie's family claimed to not know her even though a second contact on the file confirmed the owner's identity. It was very sad to think that she was unwanted. Maddie was skittish and hand shy when she arrived at her foster home. It was evident that she had not always been treated well but with time and patience she is learning to trust again. She now enjoys meeting new people and loves being petted. Maddie is house trained and uses a doggy door. She doesn't particularly like being crated. We suspect that she may have spent too much time being locked away in her previous home. She isn't destructive and hasn't required crating while being in foster care. She gets along well with the other dogs in her foster home. She enjoys attention from older, gentle children. We aren't sure how she does with cats.Even though Maddie is considered a senior she loves to run and would appreciate a yard with room to stretch her legs. She is very healthy and has the energy of a younger dog without being hyper. Maddie will find a dog bed when she is ready to sleep. She is not comfortable being on furniture or on the big bed so it is likely she was not allowed in her former home. Maddie is somewhat vocal and will answer when you talk to her so she may not be the best suited for a home with shared walls. Since Maddie wasn't cherished by her former family, we are hoping to find her a new family that can help her to forget any past mistreatment. Maddie may take a little time to warm up when arriving in a new home, but we know that the love she will give will make it all worthwhile.",

Well he hit the jackpot coming to BCRA and now we are on the hunt to get the old man adopted. Teddy needs a quiet home with no kids under 12 years old and NO pets. He's non reactive of other dogs but why chance it. He loved his bath and digs his new jacket. Won't take it off! He enjoys his afternoon bone, likes his blanket, loves wet/dry food mixed (his favorite) and of course, us. He's been very sweet and enjoys his walks and yard time. Teddy hasn't been food aggressive or shown any reactivity to us and his a good weight. If you've got a nice retirement type of lifestyle, he's the kind of chill dog that won't hold you back and he will be loyal for the rest of his life. \nTo adopt, apply at www.brasscityrescue.org",

Not an uncommon sight in those parts but this time, the chain had been roped through her neck. Yes, you read that right. Her neck was sliced open and a chain pushed through it to keep her in her yard. She escaped anyway and found angels that put her back together again. Stormy is dog aggressive and we assume cat aggressive as well. Despite all of this, she's AMAZING. LOVES people and kids, loves bones, toys, food, zero food aggression at all. She's tough on a leash but that's workable. She's 4 years old, smart as a whip and loves car rides. We believe leash and muzzle training will do her good. She was in a foster home with a docile large male dog in Texas and she loved him. But for now, we think being the only pet might be the best. To adopt, apply at www.brasscityrescue.org",

Being petted and snuggling are 2 of her favorite things. Need a walking buddy? Dixie enjoys her walks. A secure tall fence is best for her as she likes to chase squirrels. She would love to be your one and only but can get along with larger dogs with slow introductions. Her ideal home is a single family home with someone who is home most days and will work with her to show her what a loving home is all about. With patience and guidance Dixie will be a perfect companion. Won't you be the one that shows her what love is? \n\nInterested?

He loves to chase toys around the yard and after playtime he naps on the softest spot he can find for the rest of the day!! He's good on a leash & loves to hang out with his person!!\nApply to adopt him today!!!\nPlease share to help us help Riggs find his forever home!!!\nPS isn't he handsome in his awesome Project Warmth bow tie???\nRiggs' adoption fee is $175. He is up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.",

I just happened to be on my way to work when I stopped to catch her. While doing so she was hit by a car. She got a fractured rear left leg. I took her into my vet and they recommended surgery to implant a brace in her leg. We ended up putting a cast on it. She is currently healing good and it was found she is heartworm positive. She just started heartworm treatment. So with both of those conditions she is on crate rest until she is done with her heartworm treatments. She is a sweet girl and gets along with other dogs. She needs training and we are working on that.",

            "description": "THERE IS AN ADOPTION PENDING FOR THESE GUYS\n\nHi, I'm Einstein. My brother Brady and I are very youthful  8 yr old [we think], tri color boys looking for a furever home.  I'm a more lay back intellectual kinda guy. I'm quieter than my brother. Brady likes to let you know he\u2019s around. We\u2019re  housebroken and can be crated for a short period of time. We\u2019re working on leash training. We do need a little bit of outside street training because we spent most  of our lives in the house and yard. We get along with older children, cats and dogs.  We may be older, but we  still love to play and get around just fine! We\u2019re neutered, vetted, microchipped, had our  teeth cleaned and we\u2019re bonded\u2026 we mean REALLY bonded. We\u2019ve been together all our lives and don\u2019t like to be separated so we MUST be adopted together.\n\nOur VERY senior human could no longer take care of us and decided we\u2019d be happier if CFR found us a new home\u2026.together. We\u2019re ready to give you some collie kisses .\n\nSo if you have room in your heart and home for 2 collies, please fill out an application at COLLIESFLORIDA RESCUE. If you\u2019re already approved, let us know you\u2019re interested in taking us home so we can check you out.\n\nWe are currently located in St. Petersburg, Fl.\n? Adoption Donation.... for both of us.... $300",

            "description": "Remi , born 3/15/2016 is a great big loving boy that started life as a chicken pyr. He is still very good around ducks and chickens, however due to his allergies that flair up in the heat, it is hard for him to stay outside 24/7.   He is very sweet, and good on lead. He is  friendly to most dogs, though tends to want to be the lead man. His current owner has no issues with Remi and her females but he is pretty hard on brother Ruger.    He would be a great companion for a hobby farmer who is looking for a  fluffy rug for their home. \n\nPlease visit www.txpyrs.org for more information and to fill out an application for Remi.\n\nTexas Great Pyrenees Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to Great Pyrenees. We have the best selection of Pyrs in Texas and we do home checks and vet checks before placement. We start with adoption applications (no cost/obligation) and we make placements on a first submitted-first approved basis. If you are interested in giving this dog a new home, please complete an adoption form found at http://www.txpyrs.org",

I enjoy snuggles and pets but I draw the line at smooches...yuck.  Do you know how many germs are in the human mouth?!  I'm offended just thinking about it.  I am house trained and crate trained.  I am also a great friend to other dogs and cats.  I need another dog friend in my new home. Children make me very nervous...way too many germs on those guys so none of those small germ factories in my home please!  I like on my own for a very long time before Rescue One saved me.  Because I was so independent for so long and didn't always have great interactions with humans, I need my forever person to be full of love, patience, and understanding.  I will need time to relax and adjust.  My best friend will need to be extra careful about my safety.  I am a skittish little girl who hates to be cornered.  I need a 6ft privacy fence in my forever home and to be aware I am a big flight risk.  I am okay on a short leash with a harness, but do not enjoy that leash contraption around my neck! No thank you!  I am a sweet little munchkin and I've been through a lot.  I cannot wait to find my soulmate and have every day be glorious because we are together and safe.\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

I was transferred to the rescue so that I could continue to heal in a home-like environment.\n\nWe don't know how I was injured but it could have been because I'm a bit of a scrapper as I have some old injure scars on my back leg that look like they healed without medical attention. I may not be a spring chicken but I do like to assert 6lb myself and some dogs don't like that. Unfortunately, I don't take their corrections well and I will stand my ground. This could be because though I can see, my eyesight isn't the best so my judgment of their intent can be a little off.\n\nYes, I am older but I am also very alert and I love to walk about and explore. When we are walking, even though the house, I like to be all 4 on the floor rather than being carried. But once we are on the couch or the bed, I love to cuddle up and fall asleep on you. Careful though, I will try to jump off of the bed on my own and I will injure myself if I do.\n\nAs an older dog, I will need to have regular medical checkups. I do have a heart murmur that needs to be checked but it's not an issue for me. While in care I received my vaccines, a micripchip, I was neutered, and I had a dental. My teeth were beyond bad but I was able to still keep some of my teeth! I will need to eat dry kibble to keep them.\n\nI'm looking for a person or a couple who wants to spend most of their time with me. I prefer to be an only dog and please, no kids. If you think we may be a good match, or you would like to get to know me better, please complete an application by going to my profile, clicking the button at the bottom of the page and you will be contacted soon. Here is the link https://www.smallbreedrescue.org/Animal/AnimalDetails/76\n\nDue to home introductions that are part of the adoption process, we can only accept applications for interested parties who are in or near San Diego County, California at this time.",

He'd love to go to obedience school and learn to walk correctly on a leash.  no one ever taught him how to do that.  He also needs a securely fenced yard for exercise and play.   He loves life and will be an excellent pet for some lucky human.   Please email BlueRidgeDogRescue@gmail.com with any questions and/or to meet this handsome boy.",

She is very gentle with the staff and very anxious to please us in all she does. She loves attention & makes us laugh at meal time. She is a huger and loves a good back scratching.\n\nWe have found Heidi does not do well with other dogs. She adores humans and just wants to snuggle & hug them!  We have also determined she needs a fenced in yard and it needs to be a large sturdy fence because she is a jumper. She walks pretty well on a leash for the most part but we have found while in a foster home she is easily distracted so she may not potty while on a walk. She will need much more leash training which is why a fenced yard is essential. She will always potty when let out in the yard. \n\nHeidi has so much love to give and just needs a chance with a family that will love her back and appreciate all she has to offer. She currently resides with us here at the clinic. If you are interested in adopting her please fill out an application. Once approved we will contact you for meet & greet.\n\n",

            "description": "Meet Keke... This sweet girl has found herself at a local shelter and they have reached out for help. KEKE, a 15 yr old \u2014 22 lb Boston Terrier/French Bulldog mix, was selected for rescue transport to Maine through the shelter but sadly the shelter was notified by their rescue partners that all transports to the Northeast have been suspended indefinitely. They adore this resilient senior sweetie, and from our perspective, she deserves to spend her golden years in a comfy bed, being spoiled and cherished, by people who love her! ? A noisy shelter was NO place for a senior! Before her doting mom passed away, she wrote the following about her \"baby\" in hopes her new family would love Keke as much as she did:\n\n\"She is a very gentle, sweet, spoiled gal and deserving of so much love. ? She likes to \"communicate\" with people. Keke is hard of hearing, but please don't yell at her! She will pout in a corner if she thinks that you are mad at her. ? She likes French-cut green beans and chicken mixed in with her dog food. ? And, she loves \"cookies\" after her meals. ? Keke sleeps with a blanket, and will cover herself up in the blanket through the night. ? At her age, she still likes to go on leisurely walks. Her nickname is Best Good Dog!\"?\n\nKeke is still very active, and she is house trained, too. She is friendly with other mature, calm-natured dogs her own size or smaller, but her patience with playful \"in your face\" younger dogs sometimes wears thin. Can you blame her?! ? If you wish to open your home and heart to Keke, please come in and meet her. She'll surprise you with her zest for life! \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

DOCTOR BUTTS - A#43651716Pictures:Doctor Butts snugglin' up in foster care - https://photos.app.goo.gl/4qUcv5LX2TNnPUUD6Dog meets:Doctor Butts, Monteza and Bruiser - https://youtu.be/Q_9jachvs38Doctor Butts and Alfy - https://youtu.be/KkvANWB0R6gIntake Type: (1/20) StrayWeight: 93 lbsMedical Observation:(2/10) Patient presented to clinic due to concerns of decline in the home- foster reports lethargy, decreased appetite, panting, regurgitation and coughing. On examination, patient is BAR and hydrated but has a frequent dry cough, followed by the occasional hack. Left hock and lymph node remain small and comfortable on palpation. Discussed with foster continued concern that patient has pneumonia and may be developing reflux from constant hacking, as well as likely GI upset due to multiple antibiotics. Performed 4DX- negative x 4. Gave 400 mL SQ fluids, cerenia and famotidine injection. Dispensed additional week of AmoxiClav, Baytril, and Fortiflora. Dispensed Omeprazole (40 mg) PO BID x 7 days and two boxes of Cerenia (24 mg). Gave bag of Fresh Pet. Recommend discontinuing doxycycline at this time- if hock begins swelling again, may need to restart.(2/7) Patient presented to clinic for recheck of swelling in left hind hock- swelling has nearly completely resolved and popliteal lymph node has returned to normal size. Foster reports patient has developed exercise intolerance and still has a cough and occasional elevated respiratory rate despite course of doxycycline. Otherwise, patient is doing well- eating, drinking, urinatingand defecating normally. Blood was drawn and urine collected for CBC/Chem/UA/TT4. Consulted with IDEXX veterinarian. Discussed concern for possible low grade pneumonia and tick borne illness responding to doxycycline. Recommend complete course of enrofloxacin, extending AmoxiClav and completing 30 day course of doxycycline. Then, repeat blood work to assess thyroid. Neuter once URI/pneumonia has resolved for suspected BPH with possible prostatitis.(1/21) Vet Check - Patient is a senior, over conditioned dog with a large swelling around the left hock with pressure sores and a swollen local lymph node- r/o soft tissue infection vs septic arthritis vs injury vs neoplasia. Recommend starting with senior blood work and radiographs. Stable but urgent. Requires promotion for rescue willing to provide needed diagnostics and care. Behavior Observation: (1/22) Lifesaving - Stationary lying in front of kennel, allows leashing easily, halts going back into kennel, cannot be lured with treats, whale eyeing. Had to be muzzled and carried/lifted back into kennel. Minimal pulling on leash. Slow walker, lots of sniffing. Tense/allows some handling. Flinches to touch. Takes treats gently. Sniffs assessors but does not solicit interaction. TTA. (1/21) Vet Staff - Quiet, friendly. (1/20) Finder - Nice, friendly, calm, takes treats gently.This animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs.

Please click the link on our Adopt page (by species) to make an adoption appointment.Have you ever wanted a dog that is silly, stubborn, awkward, hilarious, protective, and smart all rolled up into one giant package? Hi, I'm Lilly, and that's me! I am 7 and a half years old, and my shelter friends have no idea what breed I might be, but I sure am pretty. I'm a big girl at over 100 lbs. I need to lose some weight because the extra pounds are heck on my hips, but my love of peanut butter is not helping. In fact, it's the way straight to my heart. It also helps me do things that I am normally not a fan of doing. I can be a bit nervous in new situations and around new people, so we will need a proper introduction or two. I want to be up front though, I am not a fan of most men. I don't want to get into my past, but I do want to be clear about that. Once I trust you, we are friends for life and my silly side comes out. I think playing tug-of-war and chasing a ball are about the two most fun things a gal can do. Have I mentioned I know just about every command your heart could desire? Sit, down, paw, sit pretty, leave it, drop, and even speak! I also do an outstanding impersonation of a monkey when I want your attention.I love going for walks, taking car rides, and seeing the sights. I don't want to live with young children, and I will probably be too much for cats. A mellow canine brother that knows I am the queen bee might be okay. If I am your kind of fabulous (and why wouldn't I be?), fill out an inquiry about me today. I am currently being doted on in a foster home, but I'm ready to stretch out in a home of my own.",

Don\u2019t feel sorry for him, that doesn\u2019t slow him down one bit. Clayton is a happy little guy. He scoots around the house (and outside when he has a drag bag on) and, once we get the pee scalding healed on the inside of his legs and his neuter incision heals, he will be rockin and roll\u2019n in his own set of wheels. Clayton is getting used to being held and having diapers being put on, etc. It seems the injury he sustained happened recently, so things like putting on a diaper is very new to him. We have no idea what happened to him. Clayton will make you happy with his joy of life and his overall puppy happiness. Clayton will take a bit more work than a puppy who has 4 legs that work, but he is so worth the time and little extra effort. Looking for a fantastic foster or a fabulous forever family.",

He has learned how to fetch, which is huge, and it is his favorite part of the day. Everyone continues to fall in love with him when meeting him. He's improving his communication when seeing other furry friends and to say I'm proud is an understatement!\n\nThunder is such a gentle giant and a love bug. He loves meeting new people and receiving all of the belly rubs. He is working on his communication when seeing other dogs, because he gets so excited to see new furry friends. He knows sit, stay, come, look, shake & other paw, down, touch, and leave it. He does great on the leash and really enjoys the outdoors. He is potty and crate trained and doesn't bark (unless someone knocks on the door). He snores just like a human and is very chill!\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption.

Since he tends to get overly excited on a leash he has been working on his manners as well as working on making new dog friends.\n\nThis poor boy had a hard life and it is only fair he is a bit apprehensive about the outside world. He is working with our trainer and making great strides in his confidence, walking with other dogs that show attention and attending events for a short while until he gets comfortable. He is a smart boy and wants to please so bad but had an unfair start at life. So we are working on redoing that and it takes some time. He loves all his humans. He's such a sweet natured pup. He loves playing with other dogs and is glued to his foster when home. He thinks he's a lap dog so we're working on those boundaries. \n\nHe's house broken and not to mention incredibly photogenic. This sweet boy weighs 50 pounds and is almost 7 years old. Found surrendered to a shelter with his eye barely attached. How long had he been suffering? It appeared he had been hit by a car. As soon as we heard about this guy we scooped him up to get him checked out. The first thing was removal of the eye; there was no saving it but it adds to his charm. He is a happy, healthy boy now.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption.

            "description": "Josie is another sweet neglected pup found as a stray and brought to the shelter. As you can see, Josie is now healed and ready to rock any doggy beauty pageant. She loves people and cuddles and car rides with the windows down and the air in her jowls. \n\nI have never seen a dog that reminds me so much of a mountain lion. Josie is 2-3 years old and would like to describe herself to you:\nI've been accused of being a \"Stage 5 Clinger, but I prefer \"Snuggle Buddy. I'm a true homebody, who prefers Netflix and cuddles on the couch over nights out on the town. I'm shy at first but once I get to know you I will shower you with all my love. I am equal parts blanket hog and hiking companion. Enjoy the outdoors? Well so do I! I absolutely love to stretch my legs by the lake, at the park, or just around the neighborhood; lucky for you I'm not picky! Once I warm up I'm a big goofy bundle of enthusiasm, so I need to join a family with adults or older children. I'm in the market for a forever best friend so if you pick me, it's a win win!\n\nJosie would make a great walking partner as she loves walks and hikes. She's very FRIENDLY but takes a minute to warm up as new people and dogs can make her a little nervous at first. Josie is also a super smart girl who enjoys playing fetch and knows sit and in (when told to go in her crate). She is working on stay and down. \n\nJosie's perfect forever would include an active couple or family with a yard for her to play in. She would be fine with another fur sibling but would also be ok as a spoiled only child. Josie is more than ready to move on to her forever home.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. \n\nYou can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. For more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

            "description": "Maple has been with our rescue for a year now. She was rescued along with 30 other dogs, including some of her babies from a hoarding situation in East Texas.\n\nThe East pups were initially terrified of humans and human touch and sounds or quick movements. After a year in a foster home, Maple is happy to be with her female person. She hangs out with the other dogs in the home, even tries to play on occasion. Maple initially hid in a corner of a bedroom until she got more comfortable being around the house . She is now free to roam the house and go out when she wants. She still has her safe spaces she retreats to if frightened.\n\nShe is getting used to other people coming into the home, but is getting better with the rest of her family. Maple is a sweet, lap dog that loves to cuddle and sleep under the covers. She absolutely loves her morning walks in the neighborhood. She would be best in a home with a female to bond with in the family. She needs a patient foster who is willing to continue to work on her socialization skills; she will be a faithful companion to a patient adopter.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect.

            "description": "My first foster is beautiful Benny. He is playful and his sweet personality comes out more each day. He LOVES being outside and playing with his toys, and even gets to snuggle on the sofa for pets and naps!\n\nBenny is only 10-12 months old and been let down by people; he sadly doesn't have that joyful carefree happy personality you would see in a typical puppy. He is scared and unsure of what might happen. We are working with him to gain that trust - perhaps for the first time in his life?\n\nHe's sweet and he wants love but you can tell he's still scared and unsure. The times he seems the happiest is when he is playing with other dogs. He trusts dogs but people he is wary. He crawls to you to collect a few pets and treats, you can tell he wants the love and attention but is wary of people.\n\nHe would do best in a household with other confident/social dogs. Probably no small kiddos. Someone with the time and patience to build trust and an experienced handler to help train with Benny to build confidence and set him up for success.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

I was sent directly to the emergency vet and spent several days hospitalized. I am now a year old but my early experiences have left me very cautious and suspicious of new people. I am working on my trust issues but I learn quickly especially when treats are involved. Once I KNOW you, I LOVE you-but I need time, patience and an experienced owner who can keep helping my development. Love Lemon. \n\nLemon is such a sweet loving girl, but first she needs to trust you. So slow intros with this cutie are a must. We are working on building Lemons confidence, she recently went to Home Depot to practice some of her new commands. Helping her overcome some of her fears and having fun too. She just needs a little patience and time and she will be such an amazing companion. Lemon was found sick, emaciated, dehydrated and pitiful. Living in deplorable conditions with several other dogs. One of outreach volunteers was able to get her into our care. She was only 3 months old and had parvo; she spent a week in the ER getting fluids and medicine to help combat the effects of parvo. We are determined to help this girl get the life she deserves. \n\nLemon is doing amazing now, she gets to be a healthy, happy puppy now. You would never know she was ever sick. Beautiful, playful and ready for her happily ever after. \n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption.

Lunabelle is the absolute best dog in the world when it comes to people, especially kids.

A foster stepped and got her out of boarding and she has been the best girl. She is sweet, loving, chill, a dream on a leash and super people oriented.

He lives for face scratches...and food! \n\nWhen rescued he was extremely underweight but is now a healthy weight at 80 pounds. Just looking into his eyes and you could tell he was sad and longing for a good home. Judging from the calluses on his elbows he had probably spent most of his life outside. This sweet, sweet senior needed out of the shelter and on to a better life than he's obviously known thus far. We\\I absolutely fell in love with this precious boy and know you will too. \n\nHis skin and coat are gorgeous, and his low back/hips seem to be better because he is playing and can now get up on the couch. He just wants love and attention...and a comfortable place to rest his head. He has such an easy going temperment. Loves his daily walks and good meeting new people on his walks. Dog friendly (with medium to large dogs), people friendly, kid friendly, house trained, crate trained. He's a little too interested in cats and small dogs. Barber is a sweet eight-year-old Rottweiler mix.He is very calm and gentle and chooses to stay close to his human friend. He is very loving. He gives kisses. He sits for treats. He wants to please. Barber is waiting to go home with you. \n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process. Thank you for your interest in adopting a Dallas DogRRR.\n\nYou can donate at\nDonate www.dallasdogrrr.org\nPaypal donate@dallasdogrrr.org \nVenmo @Dallas-DogRRR",

She excels at learning quickly and will capture your heart with her eyes. Jazzy has been socialized with other dogs, but she has not met any cats yet. She needs a family that will give her what she needs to find her way. She would greatly enjoy a fenced yard so she can play safely as much as she wants, zipping around with her toys or just being silly. Jazzy has allergies so she will need to stay away from certain foods.\n\nJazzy came to us from a sister rescue, she was adopted out about 6 years ago but they had a baby and reached out to find her a better home as they did not have the time. She would like a plan if there are longer workdays, so she is not spending too much time in a crate. Jazzy is full grown at about 45-55lbs.\n\nWe hold an event every weekend at our facility on SATURDAY 11-5pm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please visit our social media platforms for the specifics for each weekend as it changes from week to week.

            "description": "This handsome guy is DIP. He was found dodging traffic on D.I.P and picked up by one of our volunteers. Dip is a lab mix around 1 year old. He\u2019s a super friendly boy. He doesn\u2019t meet a stranger and loves other animals. He could benefit for some basic training. He\u2019s active and playful. He would do awesome with a active family that has a large yard and kids to play with. Also, he would do great in a home with another dog his size to wrestle and play with. He doesn\u2019t mind the crate or car. He\u2019s utd, hw tested and neutered! \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

This girl is great with cats, prefer no children, she needs a strong alpha type foster. She loves playing with other male dogs and they can even be a larger dog .  She is very food motivated. If you can open your home and heart to this little girl, please reach out..She  does sleep well in crate or with you on bed.\nIts important, not an enabler for foster or adopter\nFlo is a timid but sweet Chiweenie.  She is 4 years old and weighs 13 lbs.  Once trust is established she is very loving and warm. Prefer a  home with no  small children.  Flo enjoys all of the other pups in her foster home.  \nShe has cute underbite \nPlease reread it is highly important an adopter will have patience to develop trust.  Flo does end up bonding with her caretaker but not over night.  She is not a dog who will go on walks on a leash. She is house trained crate trained and does listen. She is food motivated so loads of room for buying love. We just need an experience dog owner who has allowed a dog to trust.\nIf interested in Flo please send us an inquiry through Petfinder\n\nAvailable in the DFW area only\n\nThank you",

Also had a dental cleaning and extractions. (He no longer has any teeth). But still eats well.\n\nIn typical little dog fashion he is feisty in new situations. \nJasper is a jerk, he can be nice for a short time - but then decides he is in charge and that is that.\n\n*** We want to be 100% Transparent. He wants everyone to know he is in charge. Someone has to be willing to work with this and help fix his behavior.   He has never had someone willing to work with him so he was always allowed to get away with this bad behavior.\n\nHe can get pushy and a mean when he doesn't get his way - he will charge at you as if he wants to bite, but as he has no teeth - it will not break skin.\n\nHe needs someone who will help him understand the pecking order in the home. He needs structure and guidance.\n\nWe unfortunately do not have the funds to hire a pet behaviorist to work with him. We are hoping that there is someone out there who is working to take the challenge and take on Jasper",

Ebony is house broken and knows to sit for treats. She enjoys a good romp in the back yard or lounging on the patio.

She does good with other dogs, but would prefer a home where she can be the only dog and get all the attention. She is 7 years old. She is not house trained, she has had previous crate training and did very well. She is a medium energy dog. She would make an excellent running, hiking, jogging companion. She loves to swim. \nIf your interested in adopting Shelby send us a message at 435-401-4972",

We were at the home to pick up a mama dog and her puppies, but that owner did not want to surrender Owen to us. Owen ended up getting loose from that person and wandered all over the Lorenzo area for awhile. He was recently found again and another person took him in. He escaped from her and showed up at a farm near Ralls, Texas. The Sheriff's office picked him up and we took him in. Owen is a great dog with TONS of loveable personality. He needs a home with a SECURE FENCED YARD that he cannot escape from and lots of TLC.",

When she first came into the rescue, her only leash skill was her ability to slip them off and she would go crazy when she saw another dog.  Thanks to her foster homes, she now walks very well on a leash and only gets a little excited when she sees other dogs but is easily redirected.  She likes all people but does have a tendency to jump when she first meets someone.  When she first came in, she was thought to be dog reactive or aggressive, but since settling in to life off the streets, she has been able to make some dog friends, both male and female.  She can be very vocal when she first meets another dog and while playing but doesn't show any real aggression.  She is very food motivated and does show a high pray drive towards squirrels.  She is a strong dog and does need a knowledgeable handler who can continue to help her adapt to life in a home.",

The vet sat down with us and informed us that she a strong suspicion that Ginny was somehow involved in dog fighting. We are in the process of getting her back to health, but in the meantime we are ensuring she is as happy and healthy as she can be! She loves people and loves squeaky toys even more!

MOCHI FKA JAMIE A#44007402Foster Email: roilaurel08@gmail.comMochi's Instagram: @mochi.dapitPhotos:Jamie in foster care! - https://photos.app.goo.gl/U17XR7Gkid45saX16Dog Meets:Jamie and Deku: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpfFVy05HTgMochi is an amazing furball! Expect your day to be filled with her special hugs and kisses! She loves pretending to be a lap dog whenever you give her the chance, but she is more than happy chilling out on the rug next to you. She will do whatever it takes to be near her loved ones and loves her walks and saying hi to strangers. She does well on the leash if there aren't any distractions, is totally fine around people, but pulls a bit around other dogs. She knows \"sit\" and is learning how to do \"paw\"! Intake Type: (3/12) StrayWeight: 50.40 lbsMedical Observation:(4/26) Vet Check -- From memos under original A#44007402 sounds like Mochi was not doing well behaviorally in adoptive home, showed some aggression towards male owner when on the couch and also towards female owner when resting on her dog bed - possible resource reactivity. Recovering well from pyometra spay, very BAR with loose body language both in kennel and when in exam room here. Very mildly elevated temperature.Behavior Observation:(4/26) Per Vet Staff -- friendly, comes right up in kennel, no concerning behaviors.(4/25) Per Previous Owner -- We noticed she's had the following symptoms that have particularly escalated today: sleeping a lot, panting heavily while in a relaxed state, licking her lips/the air frequently, and diarrhea. We believe these be could be a side affects of the Clavacillin.- Additionally, earlier today, around 3 p.m. Mochi and I were sitting on the couch and she was in and out of sleep. Buddy came home, sat next to her and gave her a new toy. After sitting with her for a few minutes, he attempted pet her and she snarled and snapped at him. He moved away and tried to identify if it was the toy. We took the toy the away and took her on a walk and it seemed to help dissipate the situation and she was able to relax with us on the bed for a while. Later in the evening, all three of us were on the couch again and she began to lock eyes with Buddy and again, starting growling. We tried to coax her off the couch with treats and redirect her to her dog bed, but she either refused to move or would growl at Buddy anytime he got close. We let her be and separated ourselves from her, but later on she was panting very heavily and I went to check on her, she let me pet her head but then snarled and attempted to bite me.This animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs.

Unfortunately, the small dog at his former home wasn\u2019t a fan. The smaller dog was with the family first, so they are looking to find Hank a home where he can live a happy, comfortable life.\n\nThanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at https://www.canerossorescue.org/adoption-application . His adoption fee is $300 plus tax. Our dogs are spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested and treated (if tested positive) before going to a new home.

I'm a snuggle bug and I love to take naps on the couch.  I LOVE to play!  I was rescued, along with my buddy, Monty, from a local shelter.  Our owner had died.  Monty & I will ONLY BE ADOPTED TOGETHER!  PLEASE, do NOT ask to separate us!  We definitely have a bond.  A fenced yard IS REQUIRED, as we love to run and chase each other in the yard!",

I'm a 2-3 yr old tri-colored male.  I'm a love bug extrodinaire!  I'm house trained.  I am doggy door trained.  I am crate trained, but NOT a big fan of it.  I pretty much only go in a crate for travel and feedings.  I'm GREAT with other dogs.  Not sure about cats.  I'm a snuggle bug and I love to take naps on the couch.  I LOVE to play!  I was rescued, along with my buddy, Eddie, from a local shelter.  Our owner had died.  Eddie & I will ONLY BE ADOPTED TOGETHER!  PLEASE, do not ask to separate us!  We definitely have a bond.  A fenced yard IS REQUIRED, as we love to run and chase each other in the yard!",

            "description": "Hi my name is Puck, and I am a 1.5 yr old  Shepherd Mix. I am a Tuba City Humane Society rescue pup who has been in training with Paw Creek Training. I am learning how to be a big boy. You see I was afraid of a lot of things and needed a leader to show me how to cope with new situations.  I am still a bit shy but with consistent love I promise to be your best boy ! \n\nPaw Creek Training has taught me how to walk properly on a leash, how to follow basic commands, but most of all how to be a confident trusting pup! In order to adopt me you have to be a strong confident leader that wants to take some classes with me.  Can you come to Cave Creek and take a few classes with me?  I sure hope so ! \n\nPaw Creek Training will teach you everything I have learned and how to grow our relationship. Because I am a cautious boy a quieter home would be best. No little humans under 12.  \n\nPuck is a happy guy, that is playful and fun. He loves to play, he is doing well with the dog pack at Paw Creek Training. Because he has shown signs of food and toy aggression towards dogs in the past, he needs a strong leader. He is dog friendly. He has a lot of energy but it's not over the top. \n\nPuck is up to date on vaccinations and has been neutered and microchipped. Puck is at Paw Creek Training in north Phoenix. His adoption fee is $150.\n\nWe are a small rescue/foster group without an animal shelter. If you are interested in meeting Puck, please fill out an online adoption application, located here: http://tubacityhumanesociety.org/tuba-city-humane-society-dogcat-online-adoption-application/ with more information about our adoption process here:\nhttp://tubacityhumanesociety.org/adoptions/\n\nOnce we receive your application, which answers basic questions for us, we will have a conversation with you, before setting up a meeting. For more information, please contact Deb at dfranklin@tubacityhumanesociety.org or by phone at (928) 853-1046 (No calls after 6 p.m. please.)",

            "description": "Requirements: A 6' or taller privacy fence, puppy mill experience, no children, someone w/o close neighbors/outside of city limits due to excessive barking\n\nJosie\nis a playful girl who had a rough start in life. She came into rescue as a one-year-old with almost no human interaction, so she will need a home that understands that she may never become a \"normal\" family dog. Since coming into rescue,\nJosie\nhas made very few social gains. She is currently on a medication to help calm her nerves but it has only helped so much. She has learned to go potty outside or on a potty pad, but she is not 100% yet. She loves other dogs and is constantly play bowing at her foster siblings in attempts to get them to play with her. She also loves toys and tries to take as many toys as she can outside to play with in the yard when the weather is nice.\nJosie\nwill take treats out of human hands but she does not let you pet her or hold her willingly. Her foster mom makes sure to provide her with treats and praise when she does pet or hold her, but\nJosie\nshakes and is very uncomfortable while interacting physically with humans.\nJosie\nis not a dog who you will take on walks, car rides, or to the dog park. As of now, she is a major flight risk, meaning if she sees a way to escape, she will, and you will not catch her.\nJosie\nis also a frequent fear-barker, especially when she is outside, so her ideal home would be someone without close neighbors or someone who lives outside of city limits. She has been in two different foster homes for quite some time and has plateaued on progress so that is why we are reaching out to our potential adopters with puppy mill experience.\nJosie\n's foster homes have tried every piece of advice given from professional trainers with very little gains. We are hopeful that more progress can be made since she is still young, but realistically, she will never be a social, cuddly pup.\n\n2/1/21 1:06 AM",

            "description": "Morrison is an approximately 2 year old male pitbull terrier mix. He\u2019s a big ole baby at around 65 lbs. He is neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, and micro-chipped. Morrison was rescued from a dog fighting operation back in January and is finally ready to start thinking about finding his forever family. He is not quite ready to make it official, but he would love to meet them and know who is waiting to spend his forever with him after he graduates training class! \n\n***This dog, along with the over 20 other dogs rescued from a fighting ring, has been assessed for behavior and temperament and approved for adoption. However, since we had training sessions donated to us, we are erring on the side of caution and slowly sending them all through behavioral training that will teach them basic manners and give them a good structure to build on with their forever family. Please inquire as to the status of this dog's training if you're interested in meeting and possibly adopting! The most important thing to us is to ensure that these dogs' horrendous past does not affect the future they deserve to have! ***\n\nWe do not have much information about where he is at with training (house training, leash training, etc.) The beginning of his new life has been focused on relaxing and healing, so this will come with more time. \n\nHe loves to play with other dogs his size and gives good corrections if they push him too far. We think he would do best in a home with no young children or cats, and no alpha dog personalities.\n\nWe suspect he was born into the operation and has never known life as a house pet. :( Despite his rough start, he is a very sweet, happy boy. He just needs a patient, kind human being to show him what it is like to be part of a loving family. He is a very anxious car rider but is otherwise doing really great learning the ropes of \u201cpet life.\" He is pending going to a training program that will teach him basic manners and give him a good structure to build on with his new family, but he will need continued training and patience likely for quite some time once in his new home. Morrison needs a resilient human that will fight FOR him. \n\nIf you think you could be the right person for him and would like to meet him, please apply here: http://muttmisfits.com/adoption-application/",

I like to think of myself as delightfully difficult. and it may just be easier on you if you agreed. I'm the kind of girl that when my feet hit the floor each morning the devil says, \"Oh crap, she's up!   Hey, I'm not perfect, buy I'm trying my best.  So, give me a break!  I\u2019m a simple girl, I like pretty women, handsome bearded brunette men and breakfast food.\n\nI know I'm just a dog but, if you feel sad, I'll be your smile, if you cry, I'll be your comfort.  And,if someone breaks your heart, we can use mine to live.  I'll always be by your side.\n\nNote:  Great Pyrenees are considered a Giant Breed.  The average weight can be 100lbs. or more.  They bark, shed, and have a wanderlust, so secure fences are a must-have.  They are NOT off-leash dogs and a Pyr off-leash is called a \"dis'a'Pyr\".  Some Pyrs do well with other dogs and some don't because by the virtue of the breed traits they were bred to keep out intruders and can consider some dogs as intruders. While they make wonderful pets and family dogs, they aren't for everyone so be sure to understand and learn about the breed traits of this breed or any breed you might be considering.",

Sadly we are confident this little guy had been abused & it caused him to be very insecure. We knew we would have to do something for him to become adoptable. \n\nChappy has come such a long way & even received professional training! He knows all of his commands including place, heeling, waiting for his food etc. He's a sensitive guy but has figured out this \"pet dog\" thing ;) \n\nHe bonds easily to people but is scared of strangers. He needs someone that will put him up when there is company over at the house & advocate for him in public-- for example, don't let random people touch him unnecessarily. \n\nHe coexists with my 6 other dogs but wouldn't be a good doggy playmate. He's more of a companion for a person. \n\nHe would love a furever home that will understand they need to keep up with the structure & obedience once he's home.\n\nLet us know if you're interested in this handsome guy longing for a place that understands his needs & where he can feel safe & secure forever! <3 \n\nHis adoption fee is waived to the perfect home!",

This little girl acts shy of people when they are standing and reaching for her but lay down in the bed and she will be right there to get loved on.  Once she knows someone she will allow you to pick her up from a standing position.  Give her a little time to get to know you and she will soon be your very best friend!  She is housebroken and will use a potty pad if need be.  She is good with other dogs and has gotten familiar with the kitties & horses.  She weighs 11 lbs.  She is all ready to find her forever home and begin her new life!  She is spayed, current on all her vaccines, including rabies, is microchipped, and her adoption fee is $350.\n\nFor more info you may reach us at  (623) 465-4835  or visit us at\nwww.vjranchaz.com",

            "description": "*Sponsor Mia!- she needs ongoing vet care which you can sponsor on our secure site with a monthly contribution of as little as $10 - or help support her care with CBD from Zoorenity! This has been an extremely effective way to help her with her skin discomfort and generalized anxiety, keeping her relaxed and peaceful as she awaits her new home!\n\nNAME: MIA FARROW\n\nAGE/GENDER: 6 year old FEMALE\n\nBREED: HOUND/ PIT BULL MIX\n\nTEMPERAMENT: Friendly, Outgoing, Social\n\nWEIGHT: 71 lbs.\n\nHOUSE TRAINING: Good!\n\nCRATE TRAINING: Good!\n\nOTHER DOGS: Mia would do best as an only dog.\n\nCATS: Good!\n\nCHILDREN: Dog-respectful children, 8 and older\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $425\n\nHEALTH: MIA is spayed, microchipped, flea treated, dewormed, and is current on vaccines. Mia has separation anxiety and is on prozac daily. Mia has a heart murmur, which may be due to taurine deficiency. This has been evaluated by a cardiologist who recommends another echocardiogram in a year's time to reevaluate.\n\nYour adoption donation goes toward offsetting the cost of this vet care as well as other incidental costs of care.\n\nHISTORY: MIA was surrendered to a shelter under no fault of her own and Motley Zoo Animal Rescue was asked to find MIA a great forever family!\n\nNOTES FROM FOSTER HOME:\n\nMIA was surrendered with a case of mange and a skin infection with possible underlying allergies. MIA has undergone treatment and is doing great! Her skin has recovered remarkably, though she will require continued medication to help keep her skin issues at bay. MIA is currently living her best life with her foster family. She loves to relax by the fireplace, hang out in the yard and just be her sweet, chill self.\n\nMia is great with cats, small children, and small dogs. She gets agitated with larger dogs, although her tail keeps wagging even as she barks. She also uses her kennel like a dream. She's ready for her forever home with YOU!\n\nFoster Update: Mia is a sweet and affectionate lady who just wants to love and be loved ALL the time! Her favorite thing would be to snuggle on the sofa with her people while maybe watching a movie, but her foster family doesn't want her to have bad habits, so they substitute lots of pets and belly rubs instead. She's SOOOO smart! Somewhere in her history, someone taught her a ton of commands, and her vocabulary is even bigger. Yesterday, you could see her trying to figure out out how to follow the command to \"put on your coat\". She kept looking at her coat but knew she couldn't put it on by herself. She came to Motley Zoo from the shelter, and before that was apparently on the streets in Tacoma.\n\nAll dogs adopted from Motley Zoo come with a leash and Martingale collar (or a harness, if necessary), depending on each dog's particular needs. Each dog also receives a \"Tour Gear Bag\" full of brochures, coupons, and supplies for your new pup!\n\nABOUT MOTLEY ZOO:\n\nWelcome to Motley Zoo Animal Rescue! We are a rock and roll themed, volunteer-run, foster based, 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization based in Redmond, WA.\n\nMotley Zoo is a FOSTER BASED organization, which means our rescue animals are cared for in private foster homes (or partnering pet stores) where the animals receive one-on-one care and attention in a home environment until permanent placement is found. We do not have animals available for casual viewing and same day adoption. Due to the volunteer run structure and decentralized/ virtual nature of a foster based group, an approved application is required to make an adoption appointment for any of our animals.\n\nIf you are interested in one of our Adoptable Roadies, please email adopt@motleyzoo.org and request an adoption application (the auto-responder also has a link to our application). We will work toward getting you approved as an adopter so that we can set a time for you to meet your new best friend!\n\nMotley Zoo also runs \"Rock Star Treatment Dog Daycare\" in Redmond, WA where proceeds from this service, help support our rescue's vet budget- however, this is NOT a shelter. For more information about daycare or training, check out www.rockstartreatment.org.\n\nPlease visit our website www.motleyzoo.org for more information!\n\nThanks for considering adoption- we look forward to helping you find your best match in a furry friend.\n\nRock on-\n\nThe Motley Zoo Crew",

He gets along with other dogs and is best in a home with older children.   He needs an experienced owner. \n After he left the shelter, he was fostered by a loving person and knows that there are caring people whom he can trust.   Otis deserves a forever home.  It is best he is with a few people who understand that some dogs take more time.  He has vestibular syndrome with a head tilt so the family has decided to relinquish him.  However, he can run with the best of them!  He is looking for a loving foster or adopter!\n\nPlease email caringsongs@gmail.com and check spam folder or call if you do not hear back.\n\nCourtesy post",

It's heartbreaking, but I'm glad they did the right thing and turned me back in so I can get a better loving home. I'm still the same loving and sweet girl. I am now housebroken too! I do look like  an oversize potato for I did get fed a lot!  I know I'm getting lonely and I know you are too, so why not have a quarantine partner to keep us both some company. I'm by far the most sweetest little girl. All I want is some loves and especially a lap to sit in. I'm the perfect size dog as well, not big nor small. I would love to be someone's best friend ! I know for a fact if you met me, you would fall in love with not only my adorable face but my huge personality. I can't wait to be the reason you laugh and smile everyday, I CAN DO IT! I'm such a happy little girl so why not make me part of the family so we all can be happy together! I will need a home without young kids! \n\n**I am currently on a diet to get me back to a healthy weight so my body isn't having extra strain put on it from having so much chunk on me",

My name is Kieran \u2013 first, I should make it clear that I\u2019m sassy and I don\u2019t have the greatest attention span \u2013 so forgive me if I get side tracked. Speaking of tracks, have you ever followed an animals tracks and chased them? Tots funz. I like to chase things. I currently spend a lot of time at a tattoo shop which is pretty interesting! Lots of people coming and going. I like people. One time this really big fellow came in and we played with my toy for a while. He threw and I fetched it and then he threw it again and I caught it again and then he threw it again and I caught it again. I like to cuddle, so if you are sitting down, there is an approximately 129.66% chance I will try to lay on you. I really do love getting pets and love my walks. If you like to snuggle sometimes and walk sometimes, we\u2019d probably be a cool match. I need to be the only animal in the house but that just means I get all the attention from my humans! \n\nPlease fill out an adoption application here: https://www.meritpitbullfoundation.com/adoption-form\n\nOur adoption fee is $250.\n\n*All dogs receive the following prior to adoption: Distemper/Parvo Vaccine, Rabies Vaccination, Heartworm Test & Treatment (if needed) Spay/Neuter (no dog will ever be adopted out without being altered), and Microchip. *Puppies too young for rabies or final boosters will need to be vaccinated post-adoption at the expense of the adopter.\n*All adopters must be at least 21 years of age.\n*We will only place dogs with indoor ONLY homes.\n*A home visit and application are required prior to adoption.\n*We do check home owners insurance or with your landlord to ensure pit bull type dogs are accepted in your home or apartment.\n\nIMPORTANT: Many homeowner's insurance companies have breed blacklists or \"dangerous dogs\" lists which include, but are not limited to, pit bulls, American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Akitas, American Bulldogs, Chows and wolf-hybrids and WILL NOT insure you if they reside in your home or may cancel your insurance if you add a dog of these breeds to your home. If you rent, landlords may also have these same breed restrictions due to their insurance policies. Please check your homeowner's insurance policy or ask your landlord regarding breed discrimination before submitting this application to adopt a pit bull type dog.",

When he was returned, our staff noticed a bit of a hitch in hit get-a-long and discovered it to be because of a torn cruciate in his hind leg. Tucker has since had surgery on his knee and runs and plays just like any other dog! He's impressively fast and LOVES fetch. He's a bit shy and needs more socializing with other dogs, but with the right match we think he will adjust just fine. No cats, please! He thinks they make a better treat than a playmate! Tucker's adoption fee is $195, which includes his neuter, microchip and up-to-date vaccines.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application. We hold adoptions at the O'Fallon IL Petsmart every Saturday and the Glen Carbon Petsmart every Sunday. Both days from 11:00 - 3:30. We are also at the Petco in Edwardsville Crossing every Sunday from 11:30-3:30.",

Medical treatments: Trazadone 100mg PO BID x 3 days Behavior Observation: (4/29) Laying down and hard barking when assessor approached the kennel. Would not take my treats but when I knelt down his body softened up. He was slightly avoidant of the leash but once out of the kennel he walked well on leash. Moderate pulling. In the yard he had a soft body, open mouth, neutral tail. He jumps up and solicits attention from his handler. Urinates and defecates outside. Interacted with Electra (dog he came in with) in the play yard.(4/29) Fearful. On approach, hard barking and whale eye at back of kennel. Refuses to approach assessor and does not appear to be eating.(4/28) Per vet staff - BAR, friendly(4/28) Per finder - Really friendly. BONDED PAIR WITH ELECTRA. Should be kept together!! Were seen together in the park for days and per finder \"would not leave each other's sides\"",

He was skinny beyond belief, scared and covered in fleas. It took days to get this little guy to trust us enough to get him in a crate to go to the vet. Now that he knows his days of running and trying to survive on his own are over, he's starting to relax but he still needs to be introduced to new people slowly. He likes other dogs but needs slow introduction and does better with females. He would do best in a calm, quiet home. He knows sit and is good on a leash. Mason loves his walks and outside play time but can cuddle with the best of them. If you are looking for the perfect southern gentleman Mason is your man! \n\n** All of our Wigglers are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, hw tested/treated, and on preventatives. Most of our adoptable dogs need fenced in yards or an exercise regimen. Please read their description above closely. Our adoption fee is $350.

I have been enjoying staying with my foster family, but I really want to find my forever home! I like belly rubs and quiet homes, and I think breakfast is the best meal of the day. I\u2019m housebroken and am quickly learning all the basic commands. You can reach out to my foster parent Sarah Fischer or to LA Animal Services directly (my ID number there is #A1729932).\u201c\n\nMy email is s_c_fischer@comcast.net, and my phone number is 815-762-4976. The LAAS number is 888-452-7381. \n\nPlease contact Lobo\u2019s foster mom directly if you are interested in giving Lobo a forever home. Thank you!",

Shes great with confident dogs but tends to get nervous with other nervous dogs, she does not live with children but had shown to be good with them when she has been around them.\n\nNO cats.\n\nShe is heartworm positive. Even if adopted, the rescue will continue to cover treatment until she tests negative. \n\nIf interested in adopting visit rockabullyaf.com/adopters for the app and more information on our adoption process.",

            "description": "Tripod (aka Clooney) is 1-2 years old and weighs around 12 pounds. He is spunky and sweet. He's a goofy guy and makes our volunteers smile. He has a medium energy level and not hyper at all. He is loving and affectionate with his humans. He can be a bit shy at first, but warms up quickly. He is a very well-mannered dog. He was fostered in a home with children (between ages 7-15) and did well with them. He would make a wonderful family pet! He is good with other small/medium-sized dogs. Tripod is crate-trained and working on leash-training. He knows how to use a doggy door. He was brought to us as a stray by a good samaritan who told us he was found with a broken leg. Taken to our vet and given an x-ray, we noticed this was not the case! Tripod has a genetic defect in his back right leg. There is no cartilage between the bones there and causes his leg to stick out. Our vet told us he has been this way since birth and is not in any pain and that there is no reason to remove the leg other than aesthetic reasons (such as cropping ears or docking a tail). His front legs are also genetically deformed. He gets along perfectly fine as a house pet. Tripod gets around perfectly fine (see his video). The genetic defect in his legs does not greatly hinder his mobility; however, we are looking for a home for him that does not have stairs. He would do best in a home that is not looking for a walking companion, or a playmate for a current dog that plays rough, as this would put additional stress on his disability. He has had multiple x-rays and there is nothing that can help the genetic defects in his legs. Tripod is just a special little guy that is looking for a special family to call his own! He is sociable and sweet. He will make a great companion! His adoption fee is $325 which covers the cost of his x-ray, neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchip and microchip registration. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application, available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab and please read the paragraphs below for more details on our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

            "description": "Peaches Goodman was born about November 18, 2010 and weighs about 32 lbs. She is a pretty girl with rough coated fur in the white/grey/black range. She is back with us after being gone for a few years - sadly, her human dad has passed away and her human mom is very ill. Peaches has some reluctance to us reaching for her quickly and when you have company she is distrustful of humans coming into her home and will need to be crated or put in a separate room. She is wonderful with the humans that she knows and trusts. Peaches has a nice energy for her age and is pretty good on leash and enjoys the activity. She is wonderfully house trained. Overall, sadly she is an anxious girl and needs a human(s) that will satisfy her energy needs and someone that lives in a rather calm lifestyle without a lot of other humans coming and going. She shivers and can get barky when she is stressed and when going in the car a Benedryl has been beneficial. Peaches does well with the other dogs here. In April 2019 she was diagnosed with mammary carcinoma with a life expectancy of 1-2 years, but if that special human doesn't come along she will be loved and cared for here for whatever time she has left.\n\nUpdate: After Peaches failed two foster homes we are considering her a JR sanctuary pet. Did you know that there are very special dogs and cats who call Joyful Rescues home?\n\nPeaches is what some may call \"un-adoptable .\"\n\nJoyful Rescues remains committed to our Sanctuary Dogs and Cats. They will stay with us for their natural lives and we will care for and love them. We will be their forever family.\n\nWe wish we could do it alone but we need your help. We are looking for people who can help us with Peaches care. Please click the link below and donate. Peaches thanks you.\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

I'm a good dog and I love everyone that works here but when I love someone I get very protective of them, but isn't that my job??? I really need a home with a single person, someone that doesn't have any company over, and most importantly will be patient with me and see that I really only want to love my person and protect them. I was adopted for about 6 months and my owners loved me but when they would have people over I became nervous and that became an issue for them. I bond easily with one person. I wish someone would give me a chance to show them what a good girl I am...\n\nLove, Nala",

            "description": "Prince is a sweet, frosty-faced gentleman that is so deserving of a great home.  He was surrendered in June, 2019 after spending his life in a home when the landlord said he had to go.  Prince is around 8 years old now and this lab/pit mix just wants to go home.  He is used to home-life, and loves his blankets and curling up with people on a comfy bed.  He has little interest in toys, preferring to get lots of attention from whoever will give it to him.  Prince has learned lots throughout his life, and will sit, offer a pawshake, lay down, and ever roll over when asked.  He is strong, but he walks well on a leash.  Prince has a permanent head-tilt, but it doesn't seem to affect his mobility at all.  He doesn't have much interest in other dogs but doesn't dislike them so if you're interested in Prince, bring in your dog and we'll see how it goes.  He will need a cat-free home.  You'll love this sweet, older guy if you give him a chance.  File#29515  6/28/19\nCall 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org for an appointment to meet Prince.\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required. The society cannot accept personal checks but we do accept Visa, MC, AE, Discover and cash. As part of our adoption process, we must have proof of residency. Homeowners must show proof of ownership; landlord approval is required for renters before an adoption can be approved.And as always we thank you for your kindness in opening your heart & home to a Society orphan.",

Phillip prefers to be your only pet and isn't a fan of other doggies or kitties- he wants all the human attention for himself. He's a friendly guy but also likes his space at times...he's had some health issues and we aren't sure how long he will have but deserves to spend whatever quality time he has left loved and spoiled in a home. He was well-mannered, fun and easy in his temporary foster home and we would love to get him out of the shelter and into a home very soon!

She will either need to be the only dog in her home or will need to find the perfect match for a canine sibling because she can be dog selective. She will also need to go to a cat- & child-free home. Bella needs time and security and will give plenty of love for that in return! She has made great strides in her foster home and loves to learn new commands! She will require an owner with herding breed experience. Apply to meet her at tailsandtrails.org.",

Billy is 10 years old and was thrown away by his family, so he is looking for a loving family with whom he can spend his retirement years. Billy is selective with other dogs. He does not like cats. He is up to date on vaccinations, heartworm and Lyme negative, microchipped, crate trained, and almost completely house trained. He has been neutered and had the tumor on his lower lip removed. Billy does have some separation anxiety and does not do well in a crate. He did previously injury himself in a wire crate. His new family would need to have some patience and work with him. He would need a family that is mostly at home. Billy may have a few quirks, but after being thrown away, wouldnt you? He is still a wonderful dog and once given the chance, he will show you. **Applications will not be screened if they do not meet the listed requirements.**",

Nimbus is almost 2 years old, spayed, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm/lymes negative, flea treated, and microchipped. Adoption requirements are owning your home, a secure, physical fenced in yard, and working with a trainer for acclimation and problems. would prefer to keep the two together but we are also aware that it would be a huge undertaking for a foster or adopter to take both with their special needs. If they were to be adopted separately, they would need to each go to a home with another sighted dog. As you can see from the pictures, they both love other dogs and thrive with them. Both also love people. They are truly incredible dogs. They are currently at a board and train facility to help socialize them and work with them on transitioning into a home. They are both mostly housebroken and crate trained now.

Jack is 2-3 years old, neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm/lymes negative, flea treated, and microchipped. Nimbus is a year old, spayed, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm/lymes negative, flea treated, and microchipped. Adoption requirements are owning your home, having a secure, physical fenced in yard, and working with a trainer for acclimation and any problems. We would prefer to keep the two together but we are also aware that it would be a huge undertaking for a foster or adopter to take both with their special needs. If they were to be adopted separately, they would need to each go to a home with other sighted dogs. As you can see from the pictures, they both love other dogs and thrive with them. Both also love people. They are truly incredible dogs. They are currently at a board and train facility to help socialize them and work with them on transitioning into a home. They are both mostly housebroken and crate trained now. If you are interested in fostering or adopting Jack Frost or Nimbus, please go to our website and complete an application. **Applications will not be screened if they do not meet the listed requirements.**",

He absolutely is not a dog for everyone though. He does have some guarding issues most likely due to the abuse he endured before he came to us. He has multiple requirements for adoption. Dante will only be considered for individuals with cane corso or similar breed experience. The home must have a secure, fully fenced in yard with no other dogs, no children and humans who will not be gone for more than 7-8 hours of the day.

Her ears are listening for signs that someone is interested in her. Myra is a 6 year old German Shepherd Dog who is up to date on vaccinations, heartworm negative, lymes positive (this will need to be monitored for flare ups), flea treated, wormed, spayed, and microchipped. Myra is getting a little older and has some aches and pains, so we have her on several supplements that she would need to remain on after adoption. She is also on medication twice a day for pain/anxiety. She tends to be a bit nervous when around strange people or in a new situation. Once she's comfortable though, she's very friendly. She generally prefers to keep to herself or be with her person. She tolerates calm dogs but would ideally do best as an only dog or with one that is indifferent to other dogs. She does not appear to like cats. NO children because of her nervousness and activity level. Myra loves toys and loves to play alone or with her person. She is protective of her home and person and needs an adopter with previous breed experience. **Applications will not be screened if they do not meet the listed requirements.**",

The parents didn\u2019t want a dog so the son kept me outside with very little interactions. As a result, I didn\u2019t acquire some skills that puppies with caring families would learn, like sharing toys with people or protecting items that I think are mine. I was then quickly adopted and my family worked really hard in helping me catch up on everything that I had missed during the earlier months of my life. I learned a lot of things but still have more to learn and I\u2019m quite willing. I\u2019ve lived with a little dog and with a large dog. I really enjoy doggie play groups and I can play forever. So while I may no longer be a puppy, I need some adults willing to continue teaching me a few things. It may not be easy for most and it may take me a while to understand that but I am ready, are you?",

            "description": "Mona is a 3yo (1-17) and 8lb Long-hair Chihuahua that was surrendered. Crate-trained and progressing well with house-training when kept to a schedule. Mona is moderately timid and will require a dedicated owner to gain her trust and build her confidence. She would do well in a home with or without other dogs. Full-time small children would likely not be her forte, but visiting kids with strict supervision should be an option. Adoption Fee - $200 \n\nAdoption not an option for you at this time? Consider a sponsorship! We spend appx $20/mth to feed and properly medicate a small dog, and some dogs may spend several months in foster care before their forever home is found. Sponsorships allow us to save more lives! PayPal.me/LaurensZoo or Venmo @LaurensZoo \n\nE-mail LaurensZoo@yahoo.com for more info! ***Please check your Spam Folder for our reply. We send out a lot of e-mails and have recently been getting complaints about not promptly responding to inquiries. Several servers filter our responses as Spam*** \n\n~~~AVAILABILITY INQUIRIES: If the dog is still posted then he/she is available. We may have already accepted applications but have not chosen one yet. Please send yours if you'd like to be considered. A \"pending\" status means that the pet is spoken for, but the adoption has yet to be finalized. This pet may become available again if the adoption is not completed within a reasonable amount of time. \n~~~LOCATION: We do not have a physical location where all of our dogs are housed nor do we have \"business hours\". We are made up of a network of private foster homes and sometimes use boarding. Once we have received your application, we can provide you with details and arrange a \"meet and greet\" when possible. We require an application before any meetings will be arranged. \n~~~CATS/KIDS & DOGS: If we don't specifically mention cats/kids in the bio then we don't know exactly how a particular dog will react to them. If we suspect there will be aggression then we will say no to cats/kids. However, every dog needs to be introduced correctly to a house with cats or kids in it. Each dog and each cat/kid will have different chemistry together so there is no way to tell how they will act until the dog is in the home. Puppies less than one year of age can always go to a home with cats or kids, but they too need to learn. With a little effort, dogs and cats/kids can live together...but don't forget that dogs will be dogs so sometimes you will need to step in. \n~~~OUT-OF-STATE ADOPTIONS: We will consider adopting to all states, but transport options are limited to some areas. Adopters are responsible for all additional fees associated with transporting a pet out-of-state.",

IF YOU MEET OUR CRITERIA FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE PROFILE TO COMPLETE OUR APPLICATION. THANK YOU!\n\nMeet Rocky!\n\nRocky is a super adorable, super active, super athletic, super playful little man. The vet thinks he is about 1.5 years old. Rocky loves, loves, loves playing and racing around with another active dog so we are requiring Rocky to go to a home with a securely fenced yard and a similar activity level of dog companion, not a senior dog, who will not appreciate, or be able to keep up with him! He loves to pal around with Tala, another of our dogs (posted).\n\nRocky is very unhappy and vocal when left alone, but a doggie playmate will reduce his separation issues. He is not a good choice for apartment living and he doesn\u2019t like children. Rocky also has some resource guarding issues so he needs a human (or humans) who have experience with training and leadership. He needs to learn boundaries, and sharing. \n\nSuch a cutie!\n\nAdoption Process: We are not first come first served. Indigo Rescue focuses on finding good matches between dogs and families to ensure life long adoptions. We deliver all dogs to their new homes. All of our dogs are in foster homes. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting one of our dogs, please use the following link and complete our Adoption Application. You can either scan your completed application and email it to us at: info@indigorescue.org, or you can fax it to us at: 888-502-7660.\nThe link is not live, so you will need to copy and paste it into your browser: https://storage.googleapis.com/gator-users/user-680788/documents/d1742bff02e44c2ea25649cb45df5103/Pet%20Application%20Form%20December%202020.pdf\nIf the dog you're interested in seems compatible with your lifestyle we'll set up a time for you to meet the dog privately.\nPLEASE NOTE: Indigo Rescue only adopts to homes within 30 miles of Beaverton because our volunteers deliver all of our dogs to their adoptive homes. We work very hard to create a family of our Indigo Rescue adopters because we want to be close enough to help in case there are any problems. We want everyone to be happy and successful!\n\n**ALL of our dogs, puppies, cats, kittens and rabbits come vaccined to their age, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting and saving a life.",

Lightly pulls on leash, urinates and defecates outside. Once in the play yard she is loose and engages with the handler. Mild interest in toys. Runs after the ball but does not bring it back. Knows sit. Solicits attention from handler while walking. Easy to return to kennel.\t(4/28) Staff -- Unable to remove from kennel today. Dog is very nervous. Will approach handler and take treats nicely but retreats to back of kennel once leash is presented and low growls. Once leash is out of sight, approaches again for treats. Did not want to push. Will try again tomorrow.(4/26) Per Finder -- a bit timid, scared, aggressive with the noose, seems scared and aggressive because of it may be a bit snippy, listens to partners voice so warms up to people just needs time to adjustThis animal may be available through ACCT Philly's Adoption Program.

Her adoption has been sponsored which means whomever adopts her will be sent home with $150 worth of food, flea/tick and heartworm prevention. Her adoption fee is $150.\nShe is up to date on shots, spayed, microchipped and heartworm tested negative. She came to the shelter 3/2016.***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS?

Eyes get progressively more pink as gets excited, but no treatment required. Would benefit from ophthalmology work-up, but not urgent.Behavior Observation:(4/29) Removing from kennel was easier than day prior. Still jumped up when trying to leash but no leash biting. Pulls moderately through shelter and parking lot. In yard, does not jump on handler but still very energetic. Zooms around yard. Allows pets all over with loose body language. Pulls moderately back into shelter. Is easily returned to kennel and leash is easily removed.(4/28) Removed from kennel with difficulty. Leonardo was very amped up, jumping and snapping at leash. Once leashed, pulled strongly through shelter and parking lot. In yard, continually jumps up on handler but does not mouth. Momentarily distracted with treats but then returns to jumping on handler again. After two to three minutes, finally disengages and explores yard before returning to handler with less energy. Allows pets all over body with loose body language that quickly leads to arousal and Leonardo returns to jumping up on handler. Pulls strongly through parking lot and back into shelter. Easily placed back in kennel and leash is easily removed, Leonardo does not attempt to leash bite.(4/27) Removed Leonardo from kennel for dog meet. Aroused at front of kennel and difficult to leash due to bouncing off of door. Once leashed, bit leash once but was easily distracted by open door and exited. Performed walkalong with Skyler (video available). Returned to kennel. Handler again has to enter kennel first but Leonardo then enters and is easily unleashed.(4/27) Per Staff -- Leonardo is easily leashed and removed from kennel. Pulls slightly through shelter and parking lot. Immediately urinates and defecates so possibly housebroken. In yard, allows handling all over with loose body language. Plays tags and does become aroused after a few minutes, attempting to mount handler's leg, is easily redirected with treats. Shows no interest in toys. On exiting yard, accidentally meets member of public's dog and shows loose body language including a play bow. Will attempt dog meet later. Pulls slightly back into shelter. Handler must enter kennel first for Leonardo to follow but is then easily unleashed.(4/26) Per Vet Staff -- very excitable but friendly",

He's shy when meeting new people and hesitant with other dogs, but smaller/reserved dogs do great with Lance. He is working on his social distancing skills and doesn't exactly love it when he's quarantined at home alone, but he's working on it.

Rosie has a medical condition called megaesophagus but it does not stop her one bit. Rosie came to us by the way of Humane Society of Northeast Iowa. Rosie loves to run, play, and romp.\n\nDue to her Megaesophagus, Rosie has to eat in a Bailey Chair but it surely does not stop her from being a 2 year old lab who still acts puppyish.\n\nRosie is looking for her SPECIAL FAMILY who can handle her medical needs & a family to call her own. Is that you?? Rosie will be posted on our website soon so if you are interested in meeting her & wanting to be her special family, fill out an adoption application.\n\nhttps://www.guardiansfortheanimalsofohio.org/adoptionapplication",

She is a black and white Pittie mix at 9 years old and 47 lbs.\n\nLola is a lover; she loves to snuggle and would love nothing more than to snuggle next to you while you read a book or take a nap. She also loves to go for walks and be outdoors (especially on a sunny day). She really enjoys chewing on bones and eating snacks (anything but celery will do!) Although Lola is around 9, she is a vivacious doggie, full of energy and life! Lola has lots of love to give, and can't wait to show her special human just how special they are. To meet Lola, Please complete our adoption application at nashvillepittie.org/adoption.\n\nLola's adoption fee is $100. This includes vaccinations, microchip, neuter/spay, and a clean bill of health unless otherwise specified. If you're interested to bring Lola into your family, please apply online at www.nashvillepittie.org/adoption\n1/18/21 9:19 AM",

I don't really know my size, so a home without kids would be best for me. I'm still working on my leash manners, but I'm smart and eager to please! If you're willing to teach, I'm willing to learn! \n\n********PLEASE READ BELOW PRIOR TO EMAILING IN**********\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog or any other from our rescue, please go to https://www.hobocare.org/adopt to review our home requirements and fill out an application. Please do not email and ask for more information on how to adopt, all the information is already available online. The information you see here is all that is currently available about this dog.

We are building him day by day up .\n\nThis boy was afraid to even leave his kennel . With a few sweet words I could get him out . He looked me in the eyes and hide his head in my lap .\n\nWhen we went outside he was clearly afraid of men . This baby is for sure abused .\n\nWe started to walk and I petted him behind his ears . The trust was made .\n\nATHAN will be a very loyal dog to the right owner who will give him some time to trust . He stayed very close to me .\n\nThis baby is only 2 years old . Can you imagine that there are people out there who wanted him dead ?\n\nUnfortunately we see it Dailey . Long lines of people dumping their dogs in the shelter like trash . Owner surrenders are the first ones to be killed .\n\nATHAN is now safe under my wings but I would like to find him a happy forever home .\n\nHe is not good with other dogs but I think it is more because he afraid of them . Not a fan of cats either .\n\nHe is a complete innocent sweetheart .\n\nATHAN is located in Middle Island NY\n\nDo you want to become this precious baby his new family then please apply today by filling in the adoption application to find on our website www.a-teameliterescuedogs.com or email us and we send you one",

Thank goodness for microchips, he found his way back to us!  \n\nHe is 6.5 years old with the energy of a puppy, slightly needy but abandonment will do that to a dog, he is definitely an escape artist so leash walking or privacy fence is best.  He does well need a home with no other dogs.  \n\nDino will need someone patient, willing to continue his training and a sense of humor.  Dino is entertaining, loves his toys and prefers to be close to his people!  \n\nIf interested in adopting Dino please message us for more details.  If not, please share and help us find his people!",

            "description": "REMY: 3yo, Kelpie Mix, Spayed Female, NEEDS HOME OUTSIDE OF THE CITY \n\nLittle by little, she's discovered herself. Remy has been with us through thick and thin aka for most of 2020, and what a journey it's been to watch her blossom. She was completely shut down when we took her in early this year, and though she's still a special case, she's found happiness and is ready to find her soulmate. She doesn't warm up immediately, especially with men, and she can't handle city stress, but if you have plenty of patience she is well worth the investment. This very shy 3-year-old Kelpie mix came from a rough past, so she'll need an understanding forever family with a resident dog that lives out of the city. Also plenty of mental and physical stimulation brains make up at least half of her 28 lbs. Her foster mom says: I cant even explain how special Remy is. She may be a bit nervous in new scenarios, and it will take someone with patience to earn her trust and guide her, but it is a small price to pay once she lets you in. Shes still not fully confident, and it makes me sad to think about what could have brought her to that level of unease, but shes made huge strides. Every little win is a victory and makes it that much sweeter. Loud noises make her want to run inside, but shes getting better. Shes letting go of the fear and more interested in smelling or interacting. Shes very smart potty trained, learning an obstacle course we built in the yard, and watches TV! She loves to lay and cuddle with me and smiles so much when she gets to wiggle on her back on a pile of soft grass or my bed. Its so funny, when she doesnt respond to 'come here,' I say, 'Bye, Remy,' and she bolts towards me. Such a smarty pants. We all love, love this awesome girl! Her loyalty is truly unparalleled. Thank you SO MUCH for rescuing Remy and pulling her into a new world where she will always be loved and treated with kindness.\" Interested in adopting? Submit an application at socialteesnyc.org or email your point person if youve already been approved!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This animal is not at the Social Tees office all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If youd like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org.

If your application is approved, you will for sure hear from us. If you have questions, please take a look at the Adoption and Fostering FAQs etc. on our website as all common questions are answered there.

            "description": "Zane has been in his foster home healing from the trauma of being a young pup in a shelter.    He has adjusted very well thanks to his four-legged foster siblings in the home.  His older sister keeps him in check and is showing him good manners while the younger ones teach him how to play.   Of course, his foster mom has taught him that humans are safe and can be trusted.\nZane is a sweetheart with a bit of a strong-willed streak, so he will need continued training and leadership to make sure he grows into a well-balanced adult.  He is great with other dogs and his home really needs another, we think an adult female would be best, but a male who is a good mentor may be okay also.  He is also learning that mouthing and jumping, while a normal puppy behavior, are not acceptable.   He\u2019s still working on that.\nWhat Zane did learn very early on in his foster home was when he should be fed.  He was very very thin when he came in, so he got extra meals throughout the day.  When Zane\u2019s foster mom found him sitting by the door leading to the food, she knew he was a smart boy.  It was, indeed, mealtime.  Then, just to reinforce how intelligent he was, when his foster was just a little bit late with another meal, Zane went to the kitchen, retrieved his bowl, and brought it to her.  Yep, he\u2019s a smart, growing boy.\nPuppies are a life-long commitment. They need time, training, vet care and healthy feeding to become good canine citizens. Don't even think of adopting a puppy unless you intend to invest the time and money and commitment required, and you can expect to lose a few good shoes along the way!\n\nIf you are interested in me, please contact us at puppies@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application.\n\nThe minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100% tax deductible.\n\nPrior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.\n\nOur adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.\n\nWe show our dogs at adoption events every weekend! Please click on events at Events to see where we'll be next! Coastal German Shepherd Rescue of Southern California is a non-profit 501(c%293 public charity dedicated to finding loving homes for abandoned German Shepherds. Your tax deductible donations go to support these very deserving animals. Coastal was formed to serve communities in the counties of San Diego, Orange, Los Angeles and the Inland Empire. We are committed to finding loving permanent homes for the orphaned dogs in our care. Coastal is an all volunteer, no-kill, 501 (c%29 3 non profit organization.",

Daisy spent approximately a year with her owner but then he became unable to care for her. She was brought back to our rescue and has been here since November 2019. Daisy is a great girl. She is very high energy but once she gets that out she will relax. She needs lots of exercise. She would make a good companion for an active individual or couple. She would be great with older kids but is too rowdy for smaller kids. She gets along with other dogs but needs to be introduced properly.",

His trainer had this to say: He is a scared/nervous dog. Though he approaches me but goes into a submissive position immediately on his back. Lets me touch his legs but not grab them for a long period. Gets very mouthy. Could snap if you try to grab his collar to pick him up or guide him (very unpredictable as he lets me grab him by the collar in certain places of the house. Near his crate for example).\n\nBennett has made huge huge progress. Let me pick him up this morning but still does not like being held by the collar. Will bite if physically pushed. But if you win his trust he is extremely submissive due to his scared nature. Will lay on his back for belly rubs.",

Located at ACCT Philly, 111 W Hunting Park Avenue, Philadelphia PA !!!Mellow A43990918Intake Type: (3/10) Stray -- Public Drop Off Mellow is my name and I'm ready to find my forever family.When I first got to the shelter I was very scared and nervous. But the more time I spent with my volunteer friends, the more I've opened up. I enjoy playing with tennis balls and I like to play with other dog friends!I really don't like being in my kennel though. I give my volunteer friends a really hard time when they are putting me back. Sometime it takes two of them.I know I'm a great dog and once you meet me you'll see that.Please consider bring me home, I promise I'll be your best friend for life!Dog Meets:Mellow and Artica: https://youtu.be/upJJZ2qezY4Mellow and Artica 2: https://youtu.be/ZNWQqeEJEsoMellow and Artica 3: https://youtu.be/3qKEcPQgfE8Mellow and Spike: https://photos.app.goo.gl/zqLqmdWFqaBNxHLr9Mellow and Rowan: https://youtu.be/0koPsiAK3GsMellow, Koala, Candy Cane and Lexx: https://youtu.be/qPUDVRfa0TIMellow and Lexx: https://youtu.be/7suUdIYsgUMKoala, Millennium Falcon and Mellow: https://youtu.be/mmbo0AC6waYMellow and Millennium Falcon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW8bP38dVsUPhotos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/185100251@N08/shares/T62Hddhttps://flic.kr/s/aHsmMdKKFkhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/185100251@N08/shares/6c6RWjVideos:Mellow Outside -- https://photos.app.goo.gl/Qq4gEKimVqT2GhMk7Mellow loves his Best Volunteer Friend! -- https://youtu.be/vXaO0C9EM5oMellow laying -- https://youtu.be/dGC4Yzi_oFQEnjoying the Grass -- https://youtu.be/9-tliHtGUzMMedical Observation:(3/16) This dog has been observed to have shelter acquired upper respiratory infection (URI), or a \"doggy cold\". They have been moved into isolation area and are started on medication, and will be monitored for resolution of the respiratory infection, they must be healthy before being moved out of ISO and will need a veterinarian to examine them before they receive surgery, if they are not already altered.Behavior Observation:(4/7) Volunteer Observations -- Dog presented at the front of kennel and was easily leashed. Mellow was eager to leave the kennel and transitioned well through aisle/building. Dog pulls moderately on the leash and would benefit from a harness. Otherwise walks nicely on the leash. He has become more interested in socializing since last week, and solicits pets nicely. He accepts all over pets, enjoys being petted, and his body was loose while being handled. Mellow loves to play fetch. Handler used trade method, although Mellow did drop balls upon returning. Dog takes treats gently and knows \"sit\" command. Upon leaving play run, dog walked calmly back to kennel with handler. One volunteer positioned herself at the opposite side of kennel to encourage dog to move from front to back of kennel. Mellow entered kennel with no issue and immediately went to back of kennel to accept a treat. No issue with redirection.(3/24) Volunteer Eval -- Easy to leash used large loop and nylon leash as well based on previous history. Pulls on leash especially when he sees other dogs. Tense in run but did come up to take treats. Did not attempt further handling attempt gentle hind pets and small touches and had quick head turns. Did not attempt tag or toys. dog is TTA. Saw baby fire through fence and seems interested. Loose with tail wags. Pawed and cried through fence. Pulls towards dogs when walking. Evaled Blue/ (3/24) Per Lifesaving -- good when removing from kennel. Pulls on leash but walks well. Social outside and solicits attention from handler. Once back in the kennels dog stopped and did not want to walk back towards his kennel. With time, patience and treats got dog to walk back to his kennel. Handler put an orange nylon lead on the dog outside of his kennel and removed the slip lead. Put dog back in kennel with nylon lead, left the lead on and closed the kennel. Dog turned around and lunged while growling as kennel door was shutting. Otherwise he was kind, sweet and social - just doesn't like going back in his kennel. (3/10) Per Finder -- friendly, docile, protective already, chases cats - does not like cats!Per Foster Home:Here are some additional notes on my 4 days with Mellow. He seems to have some fear and past trauma around exiting the home. He is timid to go into the backyard and will only go out if I lead the way. He doesn't want to stay out long, returns to the door when he's ready. If he thinks I'm going inside without him he runs to the door. He is very enthusiastic about wanting to go for a walk, he sits in front of me and whines/barks when he wants to go out (even after he's just had a potty break in the backyard), he also jumps up at the front door. The doorbell is very alarming to him, he jumps up at the door, runs around, barks and whines. If he sees me going towards the front door he runs to the door. He follows the command \"sit\" but will not \"stay\". The second my hand touches the door handle he jumps up and charges towards the door. I tried to only open the door wide enough for me to slip through several times over the 3 days and he charged against the apartment door and pushed it open to escape into the common hallway. At that point he is extremely energized and wants to go outside, he does not listen verbal commands and growled/snapped when I tried to physically direct him with a gentle pull of his collar. I was only able to get him back inside by walking back inside myself until I was out of his line of sight, he would then follow. When he charged his way into the common hallway last night, I first tried verbal commands to get him back inside, when that didn't work I tried to put his harness and leash on, he growled, snapped and bit my leg. After I yelled \"no\" at him several times he stopped, froze and then followed my command to go into the apartment. He's broke the skin on my leg and it feels bruised. The remainder of the night he was calm and laid down by himself (not normal behavior - usually craves attention) and he only got up a few hours later to observe me cleaning up the kitchen and to follow me to the bedroom. On walks he pulls the entire time; he walks very fast with his nose down near the ground and zig zags from side to side on the sidewalk. He is mostly interested in sniffing all trees, grass, bushes. Other dogs catch his attention from 15-20' feet away and he pulls to greet them, but I have held him back and can redirect him within about 15 seconds. He pays n",

            "description": "Re-introducing CINDER! Cinder came to us several years ago as a skinny stray and landed herself a foster home with her finder. Long story short, she was a bit full of herself back then and a couple of bites to the neighbor ended up with her being kicked out. Cinder previously attended doggy daycare where she basically would get along until she is overstimulated (which is what happened with the neighbor at the fence). Cinder entered our witness protection program and had been chilling and mellowing until now - we feel she is ready to try her hand at adoption. Once Cinder knows you she is rock solid. She has a job here at the rescue dog testing the new dogs - which makes her a VIP (Very Important Pup!). Cinder recently earned herself a Pen Pal (a buddy/mentor), Volunteer Caitlin - stay tuned for their adventures! Cinder is a champ at riding in the car and makes an excellent co-pilot. She is an easy walker and enjoys leisurely hikes. Good with dogs and great with cats. Cinder is a Shar Pei/Pit Bull mix and will turn 10 years old at the end of this month (April 2020). Let\u2019s make 10 her lucky number! Cinder has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and tested negative for heartworms and is on prevention. Adoption $150. Please fill out an application at www.companimals.org if you were interested in being Cinder\u2019s happily-ever-after!",

Then they changed it to 9 years old. I personally believe that he is around 5 years old. We have rescued over 900 rottweilers so I am usually pretty good at guessing their ages. \n \n\nwe are still getting to know him, but he is very handsome and very sweet. Loves his ball. Loves to cuddle. Not sure that he knows too many commands in english anyway but he is crate trained and potty trained and walks well on a leash. He will make a wonderful addition to someone's family!",

Paco is a total sweetheart, and Polly is more dominant and is picking on another dog in their foster home.  Paco & Polly are very bonded and get along great together.  Due to some medical issues, they are not available for adoption.  We are looking for a permanent foster family for these two little ones.  IF YOU LIVE IN THE LEB/LANC/HBG AREA AND ARE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING PACO & POLLY, PLEASE EMAIL AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com  (4/25/2020)  Our newest AAU rescue family members....Paco & Polly! This sweet senior bonded pair are now homeless since their mom was sent to a nursing home, and they were surrendered to a shelter. Both are 11 years old,  Polly weighs 12 pounds, Paco 6 lbs. Both are friendly with people, but were understandably frightened in the shelter.   Paco & Pollly will be coming to AAU this week and will go directly to one of our wonderful AAU foster homes.   We are looking for a family who will welcome both of these little sweeties into their home since we will not separate a bonded pair.   IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET THEM, PLEASE EMAIL AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com.",

            "description": "**Update**  (1/10/21)  Polly & Paco have been in a foster home for a few months, but unfortunately it is not working.   Paco is a total sweetheart, and Polly is more dominant and is picking on another dog in their foster home.   Paco & Polly are very bonded and get along great together.  Due to some medical issues, they are not available for adoption.  We are looking for a permanent foster family for these two little ones.  IF YOU LIVE IN THE LEB/LANC/HBG AREA AND ARE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING POLLY & PACO, PLEASE EMAIL AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com.  (4/25/2020)  Introducing Polly & Paco!   This sweet senior bonded pair are now homeless since their mom was sent to a nursing home and they were surrendered to a shelter. Both are 11 years old,  Polly weighs 12 pounds, Paco weighs 6 lbs. Both are friendly with people, but were understandably frightened in the shelter.   Polly & Paco will be coming to AAU this week and will go directly to one of our wonderful AAU foster homes.   We are looking for a family who will welcome both of these little sweeties in their home since we will not separate a bonded pair.  IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET POLLY & PACO, PLEASE EMAIL AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com.",

They sleep in the same kennel, enjoy going for walks together, and even attend play group as a couple.  They are dog friendly and would do best in a home without small children.  To learn more about these senior lovebirds, please contact Underdog Alliance.\n\nMore about Bear- This happy go lucky boy has been waiting a long time for a family of his own to complete. Bear has the perfect balance of chill time and play time. His inner puppy comes out when he has toys to play with and is a big fan of walks.",

He is such a loving dog and is good with adults and older kids. He is dog selective and does not like cats. His best home would be one where he is the only pet who gets all of the attention and can just lay around and life out his sweet life.  We saved him from a high kill shelter at the last minute.  That is NO place for any life to be lost, but the thoughts of him being in a cold, damp, wet place on his last day was unthinkable.  He takes meds for his thyroid which is very inexpensive per month.  ***With it getting colder weather, he does NOT need to spend the winter outside.  He would be a great companion for an older person or couple who live by himself or themselves.  Please help Hank.\n\nAdoption Application Link:  \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJcO2I9-K8FMjB9CNflX9xbOpIRjc0gyxzYtdkRn6zPluovw/viewform",

He has also had his stomach tacked to prevent gastric torsion, and he has completed Heartworm treatment. Grizzly loves people, and may do ok with other well behaved children, but he does need to be an only pet! \n\nYou must apply on our website for more information!

            "description": "Watching 2-year-old Handsome stride about the bark park is an event filled with beauty and inspiration. At times, he moves with the equestrian canter gait so eloquently performed by a Tennessee Walking Horse. He also effortlessly glides along so smoothly that his motion appears to be a lighter-than-air phenomenon. Handsome will sometimes pause and gaze at you with a \u201cwhat, me worry?\u201d play-posture pose that is light-hearted, fun-loving, and peaceful. This is all even more amazing when you know of the experience of his past. Handsome arrived at the Humane Society as a feral canine who had never had the opportunity for even limited human interaction. It has taken a tremendous amount of care, kindness and all the loving energies of the Humane Society volunteers to help him learn how to live in the world of the humans, without fear and suspicion. He is a shy, quiet, gentle natured creature who is learning to trust and is becoming more confident, more comfortable, and more accepting of living the life of a canine who will be a cherished forever friend accompanied by a human who will share the bonding, companionship and unconditional love that makes life on this planet truly exceptional.\nHandsome has spent some time with a loving foster family and has been the \u2018father figure\u201d for over a dozen puppies that have shared his temporary home. His capacities to care and nurture are everything that a human could ever hope to emulate. This special canine has an extraordinary gift that is both inspirational and inspiring. If you are hoping for a companion canine for one of your best forever friends, he is waiting and hoping. Handsome is fully house-trained and excels at communication and rapport with all ages and genders of humans. This is one special canine.",

A female Lab/Shepherd mix born in 2018 who comes into rescue from Texas, Thelma and several other dogs were left on an abandoned property to fend for themselves. She has been through so much neglect and suffering, and with professional training, she has slowly learned to trust humans. Now we need to find her special person to finally show her all the love she deserves! Thelma needs a calm home in a quiet suburb or rural area, with a kind and patient owner who can help her continue to build her confidence. She would do best with a calm canine companion - she takes great comfort in other dogs. No small children please. She is spayed and up to date on vaccines. If you would like to take Thelma into your heart and home, please fill out an adoption application for her here! Http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

Slightly hesitant of the leash but would allow petting of the face and neck, eventually allowed leashing. Pulls moderate on leash. Urinates and defecates outside. Approaches handler with slightly tense body, accepts petting but does not solicit. Easily goes back into kennel.(4/25) Vet Staff -- Very friendly but head shy(4/25) Social at front of kennel when first approached, but retreated slightly when door was opened. When leash was presented, dog then went back to bed and laid down, adverting eye contact. While laying down, dog was able to be looped with sliplead but showed no interest in standing up or exiting kennel. Upon presenting treats, dog then eagerly stood up and came forward to both take treats from hand and eat ones that had been dropped.

She had the surgery this week and is recovering so well.  Lacie is already happier since she is no longer in pain.  Our sweet girl deserves to have a family who can look past the fact that she had her eyes removed.   IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET OUR BRAVE GIRL, LACIE, PLEASE EMAIL AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com.   (4/24/2020)  Meet Lacie, a 15 lb. blind Terrier mix who weighs about 20 lbs. Lacie is approximately 10 yrs old.  Her elderly mother is no longer able to care for her. Due to her blindness, she can startle if she is unaware someone is near her.  Lacie has been around other dogs and not has not had any issues.  She has not been exposed to cats.  Lacie is a sweet & loving girl.   Lacie loves to receive attention and affection.  IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO FOSTER OR ADOPT LACIE (AND LIVE IN THE HBG/LANC/HBG/YORK AREA), PLEASE EMAIL AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com.",

Oh sure he\u2019s sweet too but he\u2019s more for someone that\u2019s looking for a bit of a kick before the sugary goodness. Mr. Waffles joined MHCR some months back as a transfer from a local CO shelter. Waffles had an abnormality in his back legs that causes him to walk a little funky. He loves to run and play in his backyard and even enjoys the company of other small dogs (prefers young females, what guy doesn\u2019t?). Waffles needs a home with a yard and humans that not only understand but welcome his feisty ways. He\u2019s got some chompers and he\u2019s not afraid to use them! You can apply for Waffles at https://milehighcanine.org/forms-and-applications/mhcr-adoption-application/",

Aldo is a BIG boy - 2  1/2 years old, 80lbs of lovin' - loves to play fetch and will jump thru a hoop to entertain you. We really prefer a home with a nice fenced yard for this dude. He is available for Foster to Adopt. Adopt donations would be $150, Older teens in the home will be considered.\n\nWith slow respectful intro Aldo could work with large breed dogs. He's neutered and will be up to date on all shots when placed. We will consider a Foster to Adopt placement with the right person. Aldo deserves his chance in a loving Furever Home NOW. We will assist the training if necessary with some assistance from his person.\n\nAldo is house-trained and crate trained. We prefer a stay-at-home person with minimal crate exposure and a nice fenced yard for Aldo to work off his young dog energy.\n\nWe are seeking an experienced dog person who will nurture Aldo, develop trust and love over time, while giving a young energetic playful dog a chance to get his feet 'set'.\n\nPlease contact us - GFStrays - cell: 862-200-1288, dogsrescuenow@gmail.com.

Once he has met you, Speedy can't wait to shower you with kisses and show you his goofy side. \nSpeedy loves hikes, car rides, and is a true smarty pants! He has completed basic training and has started more advance training to make sure he is always on his best behavior. Speedy has had play dates with dogs previously and is happy to have visiting dog friends, but would do best as the only animal in the home. \nCome meet Speedy today and let him show you what a good, smart boy he is!

I prefer to be the only dog in your life, since I do not like to share my toys. I have no health issues, have all my vacinations, am spayed and I am chipped.  I love to ride in the car and go on walks.  I would love a fenced back yard to run and play in. \n I am an easy girl and love my people. Please come and take me to be your Furever girl. ?",

            "description": "Date of birth: 4/2019\n\n12/17/2020: How adorable is this little Pit Bull mix?!! Kennedy is a year old and weighs 40 lbs. She is bright, cuddly, super sweet and she loves attention. She loves people.\n\n\u2022 When Kennedy arrived at our shelter as a stray puppy, the poor little girl had a hip injury and needed FHO surgery. Sadly, she is still not 100 % even after the surgery, and still has some pain. She\u2019s on Gabapentin daily to help with pain management, and Duralactin as a joint supplement to try to prevent the pain from becoming severe.  \n\n\u2022 Kennedy was in foster care over quite a few months, which has been very helpful in giving us a picture of what type of home she needs. She needs a home with:\n\n\u2022 someone who has dog experience and is dog savvy\n\u2022 a house with a fenced yard\n\u2022 no kids\n\n\u2022 Kennedy plays well in doggie day care and playgroups. She\u2019s a bossy and spicy player and can more than hold her own with other dogs!  She enjoys playing but because of her injuries she doesn\u2019t play for long periods of time.  \n\n\u2022 Kennedy has displayed some resource guarding in the form of bones and high value food.  \n\n\u2022 She has lived with other dogs with mixed results due to her resource guarding and pain level. We think she could get along well with a dog who is happy-go-lucky and rolls with things if she gets cranky because of her pain.  If you have a dog, we can chat with you more and if Kennedy may be a good match, you could bring your dog to meet Kennedy. \n\n\u2022 She loves to go for walks and walks nicely on a leash. Our volunteers love to walk her!  She goes for 1.3 mile walks in pack walks.  She loves chewing on nylabones and playing with balls.  She rides nicely in the car.\n\n\u2022 She can be a little nippy when she\u2019s excited. She\u2019s just playing, but she needs some work on that. \n\n\u2022 The poor girl has been through so much and is such a young dog. She needs a special home, but we know she\u2019ll do great in the right environment and be a wonderful companion.! She's very loving and just needs a chance. Kennedy has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms. \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

All dog visiting is by appointment only.\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS:\n-Primary applicants must be 21 or older and provide photo ID upon adoption\n-Please read through a dogs entire bio before applying so you know that you fit the specific needs and requirements for that dogs new home,\n-Dogs living in the home currently that are over 8 months old must be spayed/neutered unless medically unable.\n-Please do not apply for a dog if you are unable to adopt within a week. We are unable to hold dogs due to our small size. Dogs coming into us are coming from local shelters that are euthanizing for space so holding a dog for an extended period does not allow another dog to be saved. \n\nAGE: 3-4 Years\nSEX: Neutered Male\nWEIGHT: 70 Pounds\nBREED: Lab/Pitbull Mix\nCAN LIVE WITH DOGS: No- I don't like to share my toys. And toys are a must have in my new home!! Play dates and going to doggy daycare would be really great though!\nCAN LIVE WITH CATS: Yes\nCAN LIVE WITH KIDS: 8 and up\nDIET: Purina Pro Plan Chicken And Rice\nFENCED YARD REQUIRED: YES chain link or solid - no invisible fences\nABOUT: Buddah is the best boy! He arrived to us back in November 2019 transferred from another shelter in South Carolina where he was found as a skinny stray. When he arrived we immediately noticed a terrible smell coming from his mouth. Assuming he had a bad tooth, he went to the vet to have things checked out and they discovered an old piece of wood was stuck to the roof of his mouth and had rotted in there. He required surgery to remove it, and during the surgery it was discovered that the infection had eaten two holes through the roof of his mouth and two teeth. These holes are not easy to close and he has had surgery each month since last December to try to repair the holes. After many months of healing Buddah is finally ready for his forever home! The holes could not be completely closed due to their size and how hard it is for them to heal. He has two small holes remaining but they do not affect his life in any way.\nDespite his multiple surgeries and vet trips- Buddah LOVES going to the vet! He would race in the door and hop onto the exam table with his tail wagging so hard non stop and kissing everyone he saw. He adores every human he meets, and always left the vet with a new toy from the staff!\nBuddah absolutely LOVES his stuffed toys! He does not chew them up and prefers to cuddle them or suck on them. His adoption even comes with his toy box FULL of toys that he has been acquiring since he arrived! He literally comes with a suitcase of his things! (bed, toys, treats, bowls, clothes-he loves wearing shirts!)\nBuddah is housebroken, crate trained, and although hes the most perfect boy we have ever had- he is also one of the most stubborn. He requires a home with a fenced yard as he does not always come when called. If he doesn't want to go where you tell him he will sit down in protest and not move. Buddah deserves a home with a nice large yard to race around in.\nAlthough he loves other dogs and has many friends- he will need to be the only dog in the home as he does not wish to share his prized toys with them. He goes to daycare regularly and is great with dogs of all sizes, and loves going for walks with other dogs. So he would be great fit play dates and outings with friends! He just simply does not wish to live with one.\nBuddah knows his basic commands, walks great on a leash, loves to go for car rides and trips to the pet store! Buddah loves meeting people and going on walks with them. He is literally everyone's favorite dog and everyone knows him everywhere! Buddah is an active playful boy who goes for 5 mile walks a few days a week. He loves to play like crazy! But when hes done he naps and snuggles hard.\nHe is truly the perfect gentleman looking for the absolute best home ever where he will be spoiled and loved beyond belief! He knows his name very well and it suits him 100%! Buddah has an enormous fan club and deserves his own social media page for his fans to follow. He\u2019s won many many hearts all over. He even had a a T-shirt designed with his face on it! He is looking for the best parents who will be \u201cextra\u201d and spoil him everyday as he is used to.\nHis adoption will not be first come first serve. Due to this best boys popularity- we will be accepting a certain number of applications and be selecting the best home for him. Let us know why you think you would be the best choice for Buddah. Buddahs new home will allow him to be on furniture, and will never use a shock collar or prong collar on him. He walks amazingly on a harness and does not pull at all. He is looking for a home that does not rent as his next home will be his last. Owners with prior dog owning experience is also preferred.\nBuddah is neutered, heart worm negative, micro chipped, current on vaccinations and parasite prevention's!\nADOPTION FEE: $300",

Crate trained and quiet at night.\n\nREAD ALL INFORMATION BELOW.  \n\nThe adoption donation is $125.

If you can give him that, he'll give you all the love and loyalty you could ever hope for!   Zeus was turned in because he continuously got out of his backyard, which resulted in altercations with a neighbor's dog.  Poor Zeus was so scared when he arrived and just sat in his corner and trembled.  But with lots of attention and encouragement, he came straight out of his shell and never looked back.  He's such a good boy that is loving, sweet, smart, and well-behaved.  He sits instantly and offers a pawshake when asked, he's housebroken and walks well on a leash.  He just needs a home with a secure fenced yard and since he can climb a fence, he will need to have a leash on him in the yard.  Zeus needs a home with no other pets but he sure loves people of all ages.  He's such a doll that will bring lots of fun and happiness to a good family!  File#29506  3/27/20\nCall 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org for an appointment to meet Zeus.\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required. The society cannot accept personal checks but we do accept Visa, MC, AE, Discover and cash. As part of our adoption process, we must have proof of residency. Homeowners must show proof of ownership; landlord approval is required for renters before an adoption can be approved.And as always we thank you for your kindness in opening your heart & home to a Society orphan.",

He walks a little odd, but still gets around well.  He is pee pad trained and gets along with other small dogs.  \n\nREAD ALL INFORMATION BELOW.  \n\nThe adoption donation is $200.     (please note that are dogs and puppies are fixed-not just vaccinations)\n\nALL DOGS ARE SPAYED/NEUTERED, UP TO DATE ON AGE APPROPRIATE VACCINATIONS, BORDATELLA, WORMED WITHIN THE LAST 6 MONTHS, AND MICROCHIPPED.  DOGS OVER THE AGE OF 9 MONTHS HAVE BEEN TESTED FOR HEARTWORMS, ANY OTHER KNOWN MEDICAL ISSUES TREATED OR NOTED. IN THIS LISTING.  \n\nContact should be made through email at dog_it_dig_it_rescue@yahoo.com OR texting to 812-264-7239.  We will be happy to answer your questions to the best of our ability.   We may not have an answer to your specific question.  The dogs in our care come from all kinds of situations.  Almost all of our volunteers hold full time jobs.  We receive a lot of emails and texts daily.  We do not have a shelter as most of our dogs are in foster care.  We do not have 'open' hours.   An appointment time will be set up after we receive your application and approve you.  If you do not hear back from us in 48 hours, please email again.  You can find the application on www.dogitdigitrescue.com or you may email us to have one sent to you.  IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO PRINT AND SCAN THE APPLICATION BACK, JUST TYPE ALL THE ANSWERS IN THE BODY OF AN EMAIL OR TEXT A PHOTO TO  812-264-7239.  Please be sure to answer ALL applicable questions.  We do attend, with the local shelters, the PetSmart Nationals events that are held about 5 times a year where you may view a lot of dogs from Multiple facilities at one time.  We review applications in order of receipt.  \n\n",

My foster Mom thinks I am the best boy with the greatest personality and she loves to spoil me sometimes with my favorite human junk food - french fries. Unfortunately, she can't keep me because she's going back to work full time in August and I would love to find my forever home before then.\n\nI love attention and need\nto be the only pet at home.\nIf you can't already tell by my name, I'm always ready for a good time. Due to my\nenergetic\ndisposition, I need an\nexperienced handler\nwho knows how to give me\nboundaries and structure\n. I would love to have a human sibling as my best friend and my playmate, but they need to be\nmature 16+ years old.\nI also love TREATS! Treats are the GREATEST, and they help me\nlearn and listen\nto humans. We all deserve to treat ourselves - life is too short.\n\nIf you treat me to a forever home, I'll treat you to a lifetime of friendship and fun!\nAdopt me.\n\nTo adopt, fill out an application at\n\nwww.paws4you.org/application\n\nTo get our newsletter, text\nPAWS4YOU\nto\n22828\n\nConnect with us:\n\nwww.instagram.com/paws4you\n\nwww.twitter.com/paws4you\n\nwww.facebook.com/paws4you",

Adult only.\n***Restrictions Apply/Special Needs*** \nYes, we know he's a cutie, but this adorable face isn't what's going to get Martin adopted. Martin is in need of the right owner and home. Martin can be a bit quirky at times as he has resource guarding and is timid of new situations and people, especially men. Martin must go to a one person adult only home, with no other pets. Only dog owners with previous resource guarding and dog anxiety experience should apply.\n Martin will need patience, reassurance, and time to warm up to his adopter. Due to Martin's hesitation of new people, Martin's team requires qualified adopters to at a minimum come down to MHS to visit Martin twice a week, multiple times so Martin can build his trust and form a bond. Once he does Martin can be a complete cuddle bug who loves to play with squeaker toys, tennis balls, and enjoys a good belly rub. Martin enjoys lounging in the sun catching some rays, a nice long walk, and spending quality time with his people.\nMartin is microchipped, neutered, and up to date on his shots. If you can commit to giving Martin the life he deserves please apply today.",

Brock was a former FCDS Rescue/Euth listed dog (formerly Higgins) who was adopted out by the shelter & the adopter was unable to keep him at no fault of his own. He has gone through training & now he is ready to be your bark knight for the remainder of his years. He loves long walks, snuggling whenever possible, and being that handsome gentleman that you have wanted by your side. His wiggly ways and friendly disposition will bring smiles in the darkest of days.\n\nHe is available to come home to your castle if you are able to provide a home free of his archenemy, the cat, and he would prefer to be the only bark knight stealing your heart each day.\n\nHe needs a home that can provide him with the kind of daily training challenge that every bark knight of his caliber deserves and they will continue to provide him with the opportunity to be the best gentleman he can be.\n\nIf you think Brock would be a good fit for your castle, please fill out an adoption application through our website https://www.guardiansfortheanimalsofohio.org/adoptionapplication\n\n#fcdseuthlisted #adoptdontshop #GFTAOpack\n\n\n",

Jazzy is 3 years old, spayed, up to date on vaccinations, housebroken, and crate trained.  She loves to go on secluded adventures and then come home for a good rest.  Jazzy is looking for a quiet home without other pets or children.  She does well kids, but they can be too overstimulating for her. Jazzy would enjoy someone to take her on long walks, hang out in the yard, and relax at home.  If you would be interested in adopting Jazzy, please contact us at pawsomepupspersevere@yahoo.com",

Located at ACCT Philly, 111 W Hunting Park Avenue, Philadelphia PA !!!SOZAY - A42867462Intake Type:(3/28/2020) Return Adoption, (10/1/2019) StrayDog Meets:Sozay and Koala: https://youtu.be/mzVMmuC0UiMSozay, Candy Cane and Koala: https://youtu.be/MzSSt_Db6hASozay and Ruth: https://youtu.be/BaNzpfb9VYAVideos:Sozay dunking his head in the water bucket: https://youtu.be/lgbeezEteoEVideo:Very Good Boy SOZAY knows all the tricks! -- https://youtu.be/kD4KfjpvVq0Photos: https://flic.kr/s/aHsmMpuiyLWeight: 71lbsMedical Observation:(4/1) Vet Check -- Dog visualized having blood in kennel walls, distal end of tail tip observed to have blood on it (\"happy tail\"). Behavior Observation: (412) Pulls hard on leash, showed very little interest in toys, engaged slightly with assessor. Allowed handling with a loose body. Walked on leash and pulling subsided slightly. He began leash biting as we started to enter the building. Did not respond to treats but saw a KA and dropped the leash.(4/1/20) Per Vet Staff -- Animals behavior precludes actually PE(10/20/19) Volunteer Note -- Easy to leash and remove from kennel. Harnessed. Went into play yard, after leash was dropped, Sozay picked up leash and began playing with it. Was able to redirect with cheese and \"sit\". When tried to leave run, began leash biting: tug-o-war all the way from yard to kennel. At one moment saw dog and dropped leash, but then continued leash biting. KA came to assist, the presence of another person distracted Sozay and he dropped the leash.+Bite Details+Dog lives in owner's garage. Dog is chained when people are in and working in the garage. It was the end of the day and the owner unchained the dog because they do that at the end of the workday, when no one is in the garage. Owner opened door that connected the office to the garage, dog was behind door as owner opened it and then the dog jumped and started attacking owner's left side. Dog did not draw blood because owner was wearing a vest so dog only chewed through the vest. Owner twisted his vest / jacket off and left the garage. Owner's friend was still in the room with the dog and was trying to close the door that the owner originally opened. The dog jumped and bit friends left forearm.Was able to speak to owner. While owner did not have photos, the bite as described to me sounds like a level 3. Incident was a single bite with no deep punctures and lacerations were only extended due to owner pulling Sozay back.",

Maybe a good movie on the couch? Rowdy could be the one for you!\nA corgi-mix, Rowdy was picked up as a stray in SE Kansas shelter where Corgi Connection of Kansas got him. We estimate him to be around 3 years old.\n\nHe's a big boy at 40 pounds but very friendly. He's doing well with his foster brother, another large corgi. He has also done well meeting other dogs such as a golden retriever. Rowdy just loves to be on the go, but yet will also settle down. He needs some basic obedience training such as leash walking and recall work but he is catching on well. He does well in the house and has a super soft coat.\n\nMust have: Large fenced yard; active owner; no young children just because he might knock them down unintentionally and unfortunately absolutely NO CATS.\n\nRowdy has been neutered, vaccinated and is micro-chipped. He's also on heart-worm and flea/tick preventative. His adoption fee is $275. If you are interested in this handsome boy, please submit an application through our website.\n\nThis dog is currently being fostered in Arkansas City, KS. CCK does adopt out of state but will NOT fly its dogs.",

BRYANT - A#43918032Photos and Video:Bryant's Day of Fun! - https://photos.app.goo.gl/reoVNhkMvBw76Grg9Dog Meets: Bryant and Storm - https://youtu.be/p18wkcdog1EPersonality: Hello my name is Bryant! I am a 8 year old fur ball but please dont get my age mixed up with my attitude because I'm a ball of energy at times and I love playing with bow ties and slippers (no chewing ofc) I loves playing with other dogs and don't mind playing in a groups! I'm so happy that my foster parents have given me the chance to play outside and meet so many furballs, but I cant wait for the day when I can finally have forever home of my own! When I am at home I love to sleep on the floor an snooze the day away with my favorite hoomans *woof* Intake Type: (2/28) StrayMedical Observations: (2/29) Vet Check -- Adult pit that seems to be systemically healthy aside from fractured and possibly infected canine tooth. Patient also has diffuse dermatitis (most likely secondary to flea allergy dermatitis).Behavioral Observations: (3/11) Day Trip Notes - We fostered Bryant today. Wow! Cannot say enough good things about this dog... - He is great with kids as the pics and video below illustrate. Both of my kids, 8 and 9, walked him with ease. He didn't pull at all. He wanted to say hi to every person that walked by. A 3 year old walked up to pet him, with me by his side, and he was great. He is a rock star with people of all ages. - Bryant loved the walk. He never ran or pulled. The occasional slow trot and a lot smelling. - More than walks, Bryant loves pets and snuggles. My daughter would massage his face and every time she stopped, he'd look at her and gently waive his paw. Same thing when I would pet him and stop. He is captain love. - On par with the pets and snuggles are snacks. We couldn't resist spoiling him with some chicken nuggets and he couldn't resist eating them:) - He is so affectionate and low key. A rare find. - He was curious about other dogs. Never barked or made any aggressive moves towards them. - He needs a good home ASAP. Until then, we'll be back to make sure he gets his pets and snuggles. This animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs.

My name is Gertrude, but everyone just calls me Gigi. I'm 2 years old, I weigh an athletic 60 lbs, and I'm on the lookout for my forever home. Since you stopped by, I'd like to tell you a bit about who I am and the home I need to help me be the best girl I can be. My ideal person (or people) would have had a dog or two like me in the past, and will know how to help me shine. Most importantly you should know that I really like the calm and quiet setting I am in now in foster care, so having a lot of neighbors (like in an apartment building or townhouse) or a lot of visitors over often won't really work for me. Honestly, I want to be your one and only - kid, dog, or cat roommates don't fit that vision. I know that's a lot to ask, but in return, I will shower you with love and attention! I can't get enough kisses and belly scratches from my foster fam. I thrive on the whole snuggling thing too. I have a little bit of FOMO when it comes to what my foster parents are doing, so sometimes I follow them around to see if I can lend a paw. But the rest of the day I just sleep on the couch, relaxing without a care in the world. I'm super into my routine! I sleep through the night, nap through the morning, get my exercise on in the afternoon, and then crash by 8:30 pm. Playing ball is my favorite exercise so a fenced in yard would be best for me. During play time I look all energetic at first, but the funny thing with me is that it doesn't last very long! I prefer to stay away from busy parks because they're usually too crowded for my liking. And I definitely prefer to stay away from squirrels, or rather I prefer they stay away from me. I'm get pretty excited when I experience new things (meeting new people, visiting new places, etc), so I will need someone with patience and the know-how to help me learn that not every new thing is something to get amped up about. But I'm smart, if I do say so myself! I love \"school\", aka training time, and I challenge myself to learn new things as quickly as possible. Since moving into my foster home, I've learned sit, down, \"come here,\" and to go into my crate when asked. I'm also house and crate trained. I even learned to ring a bell to tell my foster fam that I need to go out, so I'm pretty proud of that! To top it off, I'm learning about gentle leaders and how they make going on a walk more enjoyable for everyone. One more thing - I hear my adoption fee is sponsored, so that means I can come home with you for free. And that's pretty great! If you'd like to learn more about me, please email my foster at lcfaykes@gmail.com or you can visit my IG @theycallme_gigi_Intake Type: (4/11) Return, (2/7) StrayWeight: 60.8 lbsBite Details: (4/11) Gertrude and her owner were walking by their fence, getting ready to go for a walk. Gertrude saw the other owner's dog and \"like a light switch\", went after the other dog. Dogs start to fight and owner tries to break up the fight, but he got bit on the right hand. Owner's neighbor jumped the fence and tried to help break up the fight. Owner informed me that the neighbor did not require hospitalization, said he had some scratches but he was bleeding. Owner's wife also tried breaking up the dog fight and she got bit on her finger. Both owner and wife went to urgent care, got cleaned up and were give antibiotics. Owner had the worst injuries out of everyone. Owner's other dog was hospitalized, needed stitches. Owner said that Gertrude \"took a big chunk\" out of other dog's back. Gertrude latched on the other dog.This animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs.

Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced.

Unfortunatley his finders were unable to keep him and now he is waiting with us while we try and find him a loving home. Vanderbilt is a Labrador Mix and we estimate him to be 4 year of age. He loves to be petted and takes treats very gently. He even wags his tail and perks up when he sees other dogs being walked. Vanderbilt has been around children and does great. He is working on house and crate training. He is a people pleaser  we want to see him find the perfect home!\n\nFor adoption: www.spcaeasttx.com\nFor more information: adopt@spcaeasttx.com",

            "description": "**Lola is a courtesy listing. Please contact Laurithomson@yahoo.com for adoption information.**\n\nLola is an affectionate 3-year-old spayed female pit bull mix who was rescued from a high-intake public shelter and is eager to find her forever home. Weighing about 65 lbs, Lola is a sweet and silly girl who loves to meet new people. Her other favorite activities include cuddling, playing with squeaky toys (the squeakier, the better!), patrolling for squirrels, going for rides in the car, and playing tug-of-war. She is also really good at sleeping. Lola relishes being close to her human and is a bit of a homebody: her favorite place is at home with her people. When she was rescued and moved into a foster home, she was overwhelmed by unfamiliar noises and things. She has made huge progress, and is now more confident walking around the neighborhood and going on hikes. She will thrive in a forever home that will continue to provide her with patience and structure as she continues to push the horizons of her world and to feel more confident in different settings. Lola is housebroken, knows how to walk on a leash, and has learned a number of obedience skills in her foster home. She is treat motivated, and is a good student. Lola needs to be your one-and-only companion animal, at least until her new human(s) get to know her and build a relationship with her. With all of the love and attention she wants to bestow on her human(s), you won't need anyone else! We also think she should be in a home with adults and teenagers as she doesn't have experience yet around younger kids. Lola would appreciate being in a home with a fenced yard in which she can run around and play when not snoozing on a comfy dog bed at your feet. Lola is a funny, charismatic, and loyal girl who will be a devoted best friend in a home eager to welcome her.\n\nCheck out the hashtag #Lolaisalover for more images and video of Lola on Instagram.\n\nLola is spayed, microchipped, and current on vaccinations.\n\nAdoption application, home check, and adoption donation apply.\n\nLola is a courtesy listing. Please contact Laurithomson@yahoo.com for adoption information.\n\n1/4/21 5:02 PM",

            "description": "Meet Diego. Diego and his brother Pugsley (see his listing) have been through a lot together. They are a bonded pair and we will not consider splitting them up.\nAt approximately eight years of age, these two buddies lost their person, and were left alone, but together, in their home. Luckily a family member cared for them there, but they needed a place to go, and quickly, as their house was being sold. \nWe saw these two on a rescue page, and many people reached out to us, hoping we could help these sweet seniors find a safe place to stay. We just couldnt say no. Thanks to a very kind foster, we were able to take the boys in on very short notice.\nEveryone who meets these two cant say enough about how sweet they are. This is what they're foster parents have to say about them:\nPugsley is an adorable Puggle who is easygoing and lovable. He favorite thing is belly rubs and of course food. He also enjoys going for walks which has helped him lose weight. There are times when he gets scared of going up long flights of stairs and even just with a couple stairs, he needs encouragement. He has the cutest teddy bear-like face and there are times he may get anxious and cry but can easily be calmed down with a belly rub or chin rub. Currently Pugsley takes Gabapentin twice a day and one other pill to help with his joints although he seems to be doing amazing. The pills go right into his food so it is easy. We have tried lowering the dose of the Gabapentin per the vet since he seems to be doing so well. He goes on long walks and runs around in the backyard. We describe him as the perfect dog who just wants love.\n\nDiego is a feisty Pomeranian mix with great energy for his age and very smart. He likes to cuddle but can also be independent. Diego loves going out for walks but gets so excited that he barks a lot but it is only because he can't wait to get outside. Sometimes he bites his leash as if to walk himself. Ideally a fenced in backyard is good for him that is secure because he has been known to try and sneak out. He does not take any medication on a regular basis.\n\nThey get along 95% of the time and love to lay together on a dog bed or blanket on the floor. Pugsley loves to eat and tries to eat Diego's food when he finishes his own so it is important to monitor that. Diego also does not have a lot of teeth but can eat kibble and soft food where the chunks are cut into small pieces. They also both like cantaloupe and bananas. Diego also likes cucumbers cut in small pieces. Occasionally, Diego may have an accident in the house, but otherwise they are trained to go outside.\n\nThese two boys dont ask for much...just a loving, patient, cat -free home where they could finally settle into a routine and call someplace home again. They love to play in a fenced yard, and would prefer the company of mature humans...so an adult home, or one with understanding older children would be kindest.\n \nAdopt double the love today with this bonded pair. Submit your application: https://www.hharteam.org/adoption-form/\nDiego and Pugsley's adoption fee is $250 to a qualified adopter.",

She is super smart and learns quickly. \n\nShe has ZERO problems with her bone disorder other than the one time in 3 months of having a fever, which was a quick and relatively inexpensive treatment that resolved it. \n\nShe did well with our alpha male at first, and did fine with our non confrontational females. Sadly we had to separate her from that group because those are his girls...and she and his alpha dominance caused a problem. \n\nShe just wants to be loved..and taught how to be a dog...a puppy still..and needs a patient owner. \n\n\nMust provide phone number with inquiry.. \n",

Experienced owners only.\n\nUpdate 9.11.2020 she has been with us 8 months and her Craniomandibular Osteopathy has absolutely no restrictions for her. She is not on meds, she is not in any pain, and she is slowly outgrowing the bone growth shift.  Please dont let this deter you..she is a sweetheart, she is smart, but she requires an experienced owner with an active bully.\n\nUPDATE..4.22.2020 Lila has been with us for nearly 3 months ..she was closer to 7 months when she left Broward and she was showing signs of pain there but with us she didnt..she was on anti inflammatory meds but hasnt been on them either for some time. \n\nShe eats hard kibble just fine.. requires hard toys.. stuffies don't stand a chance... she plays hard with our othet pocket bullies..loves to snuggle and is super spazzy but also incredibly sweet. \n\nWe have had only one fever flare and that was remedied by meds. \n\nPlease research Craniomandibular Osteopathy and see if you feel she is just as equally worth the chance we felt she deserved.  She can outage this!!\n\nMore about her personality in the bio section.\n\n\nFROM THE SHELTER VETERINARIAN: prior to her arrival \n\nLulu is only 6 months old but this sweet puppy appears to have a rare bone condition consistent with Craniomandibular \n\nA bone disorder of growing dogs, this condition causes oral discomfort, weight loss, fever, and palpable enlargement of the mandible. \n \nLulu is still a young pup and we are hopeful that with medications to reduce inflammation and discomfort, along with a soft food diet, her prognosis will improve with time. \n\nIt is a painful condition however, and although Lulu is currently on pain medication, she needs a rescue to help her get out of the shelter as soon as possible and provide continued management so that she has the chance to have a normal life.  \n",

He got some attention from neighbor kids who would pet him through the chain link but nothing else. He is loving his freedom and being spoiled in his foster home. He needs a home with either no other dogs, or female dogs.  He isn't fond of males.  10 years old, 70 pounds.",

            "description": "Please contact ADOPTION (adopt@doggieharmony.org) for more information about this pet.Scooby is looking for a special home. He is a big, young guy (3 years old) and looks like he weighs close to 90 pounds. Scooby adores people. He loves belly rubs and getting treats. His eyes will melt your heart. He truly is the sweetest dog.\nHis biggest obstacle on getting out of the shelter is he can climb out of a 10 foot high chain link fence. He can jump a 5-6 foot fence easily and he will show you his skills if he sees another animal. Scooby is under the impression that all other animals are bad. He wants him and his people to be the only breathing things on his property.\n\nScooby needs training. He is smart and could be worked with. He is hoping someone with no other pets who happens to have an 8 foot high wooden fence and lives out in the country will be his hero. He doesn't want to live his life in a little boxed in kennel. He has too much love to give.\nIf you are willing to adopt him I bet our Castoff family on FB could raise the money to build a fence for him if that would help.\nFor more information, please call (706) 487-4539.\n\nAge: 2 years\nWeight: 75 lbs\nTemperament: Gets along adults and teens.\nTraining: house-trained, Crate-trained, would benefit from basic training\nVetting: neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and heartworm negative\nContact adopt@doggieharmony.org with questions or complete/send an Adoption Application for fastest response. We look forward to hearing from you.\nTo ensure we're meeting both pet and adopters' needs, we ask potential adopters to complete an Adoption Application ( www.bit.ly/DH-Adoption ) for caretakers to review. Once approved, we will bring the adoptable pet to your home for a preliminary visit. We are 100% donation funded, so please expect a minimal fee of $250 to cover each pet's basic vetting.",

Strider does have leash issues. Once Strider realizes he\u2019s on a leash he shows those behavioral issues. Strider does not like anything being on or around his collar line. Strider needs someone who is bloodhound savvy and can continue working with a trainer on his behavioral issues. Strider is happiest when he is out and about running around so a big yard would be ideal. If you think Strider or any of the 50+ hounds would be a good fit for you submit an adoption application at www.daphneyland.com",

We now have him flea free and most of his hair back and turns out Boz is probably under 4 years old. He thinks he's a puppy most days bouncing and playing like a silly happy dog should. He is friendly but takes a little bit of time to trust you, but once he does oh what a lover boy he is. He does like the girl dogs and with a boy with manners he'd probably be ok. He will do anything for a treat so that will help with his continuing training. Volunteers have taken him off site for a hike and said he behaved perfectly even walking with new dogs. Bozley is one special boy and truly deserves to find a family to call his own. Please call and make an appointment to meet him.  518-873-5000 Update:  Bozley has recently been diagnosed with allergies and is now on a special medicine that he will need for life.",

She loves being with people and will jump right in your lap if you let her! Other than cuddling, her favorite thing to do is play fetch. She is estimated to be about 7 years old but still has lots of energy!\n\nUnfortunately she was bred many times and we believe that is what has led to her not getting along with other dogs. \n\n**We do not do out of state adoptions**\n\nTo do our part to contain the spread of COVID-19, The Animal Haven is only open by appointment for approved applicants until further notice.

            "description": "Hope was rescued from a Houston shelter at the very last minute!\n\nWhen Austin Cats and Dogs Rescue was alerted, we quickly mobilized to find a foster home for her.  \n\nShe is safe and settling in after what was a very stressful experience of being sheltered, and being separated from her babies.\n\nShe shows signs that she was probably used for breeding, and was not socialized with a loving family in her previous life.\n\nOur goal is to work with her in a foster home, or to place her with an adopter that is committed to giving her security, affection, and confidence that she will be safe and loved for the rest of her life.\n\nAre you that person?  We will be selective in choosing a new home for Hope, because she does need work reaching her full potential.\n\nShe loves being with the other pets in her current foster home, and they are her bridge to developing a bond with the humans in the home.  She enjoys the structure and routine that she never had before.  It might be a must that her adopter have another well-socialized pet, as that would ease her in transitioning.\n\nHope is positive for heartworms, and will be treated at our expense.\n\n**Potential adopters must be aware that at the present time Hope will not allow anyone to pet her or come near her, and she needs a lot of work.  She needs a patient family to work with her by feeding her right out of their hands, to assure her and to develop trust.\n\nShe will not let humans touch her, so she needs help in that area and, therefore, she cannot be leashed.  \n\nShe will have to stay in the house and in a secure backyard for a long time until she overcomes this fear.\n\nShe is nice and friendly, but doesn't want dogs or humans approacing her. Hope does not hurt anyone, but will bark if someone walks toward her. \n\nATXcatsdogs@gmail.com is contact for potential fosters or adopters!\n\nPets are adopted to homes in the Austin, Texas, metro area, only.\n\nFor more photos and info:\n\nFollow us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/austincatsanddogsrescue/\n\nFollow us on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/austin.catsanddogs.rescue",

            "description": "Odin is a now-healthy year old pup with a sense of adventure and curiosity about his surroundings. He came to RESCUEDohio as a very sick dog, with severe bone deformation and dental problems. After 4 surgeries and a long, painful recovery, his legs are mended and he's ready to play!\n\nBecause Odin has been cooped up in a crate, wearing a cone for most of his young life, and because he has only recently gained the use of his legs, he has been a very frustrated puppy. His frustrations come out through mouthiness. Odin will need to be kept in supply of durable chew toys as he loves to chew and is used to this activity as his only form of exercise. These days, Odin is free to walk on leash, play with other dogs, and fetch toys over a short distance. He is not a suitable companion for a runner, and should not be forced to run or do any extreme weight-bearing exercises.\n\nOdin's mouthiness can come out in the form of resource guarding. His foster mom is teaching him \"no\" and he is learning that when he listens to her, he is rewarded with even better toys and treats than whatever it is he is guarding. Odin will need to live in a home with people who are experienced at dog training, to help reinforce good manners and set him up for a good experience in life. We do not recommend that Odin lives in a home with small children, as we do not want him to resource guard children's toys.\n\nOdin has not been cat tested, but he is very dog friendly and has lived with both male and female dogs of all sizes and has wanted to play with all of them! In fact, he lives with his foster brother Buddy and they are best friends. They love to play chase and have wrestling matches in the backyard (check out his bio and consider adopting both!).\n\nOdin has very specific needs and we will only consider applications that can give him what he needs to in his forever home. Odin will require a forever home with a fenced in yard. Odin's adoption fee is $300 and meet and greets can be arranged for approved adopters; apply today at rescuedohio.org!",

            "description": "We will not be showing dogs until Science Based Home restrictions are lifted for non-essential businesses but are reviewing applications for the best fit for each dog.\n\nDiesel is a one of a kind dog. He is neutered, male that is approximately 2 years old (2020). He came to MAPS after he was pulled within hours of being euthanized at the shelter he came from. Diesel also had a bad case of \u201chappy tail\u201d, which is a cut at the end of the tail from whacking it hard on surfaces. It took many months to get DIesel\u2019s happy tail to fully heal, and he was a good sport with the bandaging and treatment. \n\nDiesel is a great listener and knows sit and wait. He can hardly contain himself while he waits for a treat though and will bounce up and down while whining as if to say \u201cI need that treat now.\u201d  Diesel is a dog who has really come into his own since joining his foster home. He is one of the best walkers in the rescue. He will check in with his people, and does not pull hard; even when there are distractions. Diesel also enjoys playing fetch, and loves to show how athletic he is. He is able to catch balls on the move and is very coordinated. \n\nDiesel is a guy who will help provide purpose to your life. He will help you realize the importance of living in the moment, and looking beyond yourself.  He was given a second chance at life, and he can help you realize all the things we can be thankful for. Complete an application to begin the process toward starting a long, positive relationship with this special guy.\n\nApplication Process\n\nMAPS\u2019s adoption process is designed to help best place dogs with homes that are in the best interest of the dog and their human companions. The adoption process starts with a prescreen review of a Guardian Application. Making decisions about dog placement in adoptive homes is an \"art\", not a \"science\", and there will be times when applications will be denied for various reason(s). This is left to the discretion of the MAPS after reviewing relevant information. MAPS reserves the right to make all decisions regarding placement or final disposition of any rescued dog in its care into a foster or adoptive home. There is absolutely no guarantee, made or implied, that any person or persons requesting to adopt a dog being fostered through MAPS, or posted on MAP's web site, will be granted an adoption. After a successful prescreen, including background checks, the applicant(s) are notified that they can visit the dogs and a time slot is made for the dog and applicant interaction. After the interaction we encourage several days of reflection before adopting a pet to help assure this will be a lifetime commitment of love and quality care for the dog. Next we conduct a home/neighborhood visit to the Guardian Applicant's home. If the home visit proves successful the new mom and/or dad of the dog will sign an Adoption Agreement and share a lifetime of love and mindful growth !\n\nGuardianship Application available for download at\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/MAPSFiles\n\nMAPS Dog Rescue Mission\n\nMidwest Area Pit Stop, Inc. (MAPS) is a foster home based rescue located in Madison, Wisconsin established in 2005 after being part of the Chicago Illinois based rescue Furry Friends for several years. MAPS focuses on providing a structured, safe calm environment for the dogs in their care that helps them flourish. This structured home environment is complimented by exercise, Positive Reinforcement Deference Training, very high quality dog food in addition to a broad spectrum of proven food supplements including vitamins and supplements. In addition to fostering, MAPS provides sponsorship funds to help with the veterinary expenses and/or Breed DNA testing to save dogs in need of a rescue at the end of their options. MAPS has been active in the community promoting dog safety, how to build a healthy relationship with your dog, and fighting breed discrimination including breed testing of hundreds of dogs since December 2007. MAPS believes that dogs are a central component for people to have a more meaningful and purposeful life. That is, if people are willing to embrace mindfulness in daily living. Dogs help us connect to reality and make life worth living through example and deep bonds. MAPS is not about how many dogs are adopted in the shortest amount of time but rather measures to help insure the dogs that are adopted do not come back for the wrong reasons.\n",

            "description": "My name is Sadie. I am a lab/boxer mix. My estimated birthday is September 24, 2015. I weigh 42 pounds and I am full grown. I am a sweet, playful medium sized girl. I am completely house trained. I am very friendly with dogs and considerate children over 10 years old. I have attended training classes so I am smart and a good listener. I walk nicely on a leash and have learned all the basic commands like come, sit, wait, stay, etc. I love to play ball, but most of all I enjoy spending time with my human. I am good with children of all ages, but should probably go to a home with children 10 years or older. I will need a new family that is willing to continue attending training classes with me, so we can learn how to work on some of my skills I need more work on. It is important that my new family spends time with me and includes me in their activities. I enjoy socializing. I am very social and thrive on being loved on and occasionally sitting on your lap for lots of love and attention. I'm looking for a family that has a secure backyard. I am a beautiful fun loving girl. \n\nAdopter for Sadie must be at least 25 years old.  Adoption fee for Sadie is $600.00.\n\nSadie is currently in Texas but will travel to the PNW once an adopter has been found.\n\n***The first step in the process if you are interested in being considered for Sadie, is to email us information about yourself and your family. A brief introduction to your family will be helpful in determining if Sadie will be a good fit for your family. Please include where you live, current/past vet, etc. Send your inquiry to rogarcia58@yahoo.com. Do not inquire through the Petfinder site. Those inquiries are not being received by the rescue organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

I am calm and have a great temperament.  I am completely house trained. I am not crated anymore because I do so well when I am loose in the house. I have my favorite chair and that is where I sleep during the day when it's time for me to take a nap and I also sleep there at night. I walk well on a leash and enjoy going for walks. I'm a quick learner and a very good listener. I like to make my humans happy so I follow commands well. I do best when provided with stimulating toys to keep me busy. I love my Kong and activity ball. I do well with considerate children over 6 years old. Some good activities for me are walks, hikes, going out to eat at pet friendly establishments or other fun activities you enjoy doing. \nI need a home with a secure wooden fully fenced backyard. If you're interested in a loving companion and a good girl I could possibly be a good fit for your family. \n\nAdopter for Dottie must be at least 25 years old.

Cupcake loves to flop over with a flair of drama queen anytime she sees someone who might be willing to give her belly scratches.  This girl is an absolute sweet heart.  \n\nCupcake is looking for a home where she can be showered with love as the only pet. She enjoys older kiddos and would love to be able to sleep with them.  Cupcake will do best in a house with a yard. She is not a good fit for an apartment/condo.  \n\nVaccinated, spayed, Utd on shots. She is crate trained, good on a leash and ok in the car.  \n\n$75 adoption fee.  Cupcake is adoptable through Pittie Me Rescue. If you are interested in fostering or adopting Cupcake, please fill out an application at www.pittiemerescue.org/forms.html \n\n",

Sadly, the rescue has had no room at the inn for me and my sister as far as a foster home is concerned so we're still with our parents' owners. The rescue has gotten us fully vetted and will work with us on leash prior to adoption but we will still need an experienced adopter, preferably with a fenced in yard. We have had very little socialization or human contact in these first 7 months of life but each of our siblings are doing great now that they are in new homes. We aren't aggressive at all, we just need to be shown what's what. We don't know about toys or kisses and haven't been inside but are eager to learn about all that life has to offer once we feel safe in our new surroundings. With a little patience and understanding, we will both turn out to be loyal companions. We love other dogs and can be cat tested if need be, as we've never been around one. Due to our circumstances and age, we keep getting bypassed for typical bouncy youngsters.

We don\u2019t want people to forget about all these animals who wait patiently day in and out to find their forever home. Watts is one of those many dogs. He has been with us for awhile now and really deserves a second chance at life. He is super sweet, social with all people, good with submissive or neutral dogs and good with cats. Due to resource guarding issues we recommend an adult only home. He loves loves to play ball and will run for hours on end. He is fully trained in off leash obedience and comes with lessons for his new owner. Please help us find this guy a soft place to rest his head with a family that will love him forever.

            "description": "Friends to the Forlorn\nAdopt-a-BullBreed: Pit Bull Terrier Gender: Female Estimated Date of Birth: April 7, 2013 Size: 60 lbs Location: Dallas, GA\nRESCUING RUBY\nRuby came into Paulding County as a stray at the beginning of March 2020. They immediately noticed she had some unsteadiness. She has some moments of being totally fine and others where she is unsteady on her feet and falling over herself. She was still eating and drinking normally and even did well with other dogs through the kennel. Our friends at Paulding put out a rescue plea and one of our amazing previous adopters met her and agreed to foster! Ruby got her freedom ride on April 8, 2020.\nABOUT RUBY\nDespite being a little off balance, Ruby is a complete wiggle-butt and warms up to people immediately. She has the sweetest demeanor and craves human affection! She is enjoying life in her foster home and gets along well with most other dogs, including her doggie foster-siblings. She completely ignores the resident cats and has zero prey drive outdoors. Initially her foster family thought she was just stubborn; however, much to their surprise, Ruby is actually deaf! She is a little slow to move around, but when she's excited, she can move a short distance. She loves wandering around the yard, but due to her deafness, Ruby has no concept of vehicle traffic and certainly will not come when called so she will need either a fenced yard or a family that is committed to always keeping her on leash. In almost all instances, Ruby's demeanor is very chill, although she is a rope-tug champion, will occasionally attacks pillows left in her reach, and sings when she's crated. Ruby is spoiled rotten and can't stand being away from her people, but when they leave the house, she simply takes up residence on the couch for a long nap (snoring like a hot rod motor!). She won't wake up when you get back since she can't hear you coming.\nRuby would love a family where she can live out her golden years. She most likely had a stroke or possibly some other neurological damage that causes the slight droop in her face and wobbly gate, but she's not one for activity anyway. She is a laid back, slow, stop and sniff the roses kind of gal. Ruby would do best in a home with minimal or no stairs.\nRuby is still heartworm positive and hasn't started treatment yet, but we have been addressing some skin issues that needed antibiotics first.\n*Please check back for updates on this lucky lady*\nPhoto Album of Ruby: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=3068473496544129\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

Gen has been with us for a couple of years, but her adopters have a special needs adult son that Gen is uncomfortable around so we need to rehome her.  Gen is a big girl, who ADORES her people.  She likes to ride in the car, and is housebroken and can be left free in the home when no one is home.  Gen wants a quiet home, with not a lot of people in and out...she doesn't like new situations.  She is a perfect dog for a single, or a couple who live a quiet lifestyle.  She's a beautiful girl!",

            "description": "Incredibaly Smart!Roxy was born about May 6, 2018 and weighs about 30 lbs. She pretty much looks like a large Jack Russell, but we are just guessing at her breed. She came to us from a home with three kid and another older large dog who she would harass to play with her, but there was no interest. Roxy has a lot of energy and needs a person who will give her that release or another dog to really play with her and she's a bit on the rough side. Roxy has a TON of personality and she needs her new humans to be smarter than she is. I've learned that some dogs are so very smart that they are labeled as bad dogs which is what Roxy was labeled when she came here. Roxy had nipped a couple of the kid's friends when they entered the home or when running around. And then there was the UPS driver when she was on the electric fence...yes, it's true that some humans have an e fence for their dogs that INCLUDE the driveway - not been able to figure that one out. So, going forward she either needs a rural environment or a physical fence and an adult only home and when there are guests she should be crated or closed in a room. In the evening she is a major lap dog and soaks up the love. She lays among all the other dogs at the main site and all is good. She would run from her owners when they wanted to pick her up and just a bit ago I tried that and she did back away, so easy, peasy, I looped a leash, put it around her neck and drew her to me - no problem. This is not a horrible dog and thankfully she came here as she would not have walked out of most other shelters. Again, we need humans that are going to figure her out and enjoy the intelligence, the comedy, the energy, of this 30 pounds of dynamite and will keep her from injuring any humans. Roxy has a ZEST for life! The Adoption Fee for this dog is $300.00.\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

            "description": "I have started a new adventure! I have enrolled in what the hoomans call the Prison Program so I won't be available for awhile. I am learning how to be around lots of people and gaining confidence in my surroundings! Hello! My government name is Mini Milky, but my fosters renamed me Yeti. Im about 11 months old and about 40lbs now, but I still might have a little growing to do. Im very shy and wary of new people. It will take me awhile to warm up to you, so I need a forever home with VERY patient humans who will give me the time I need to feel comfortable while also pushing me outside of my comfort zone in healthy ways. I have a spunky personality and playful energy once Im out of my shell. Im quite silly, and I love to play with the other dogs in my house. I would probably do best in a home with one or two adult humans and one or two other dogs. Although I am afraid, I am not aggressive. I really like to have a consistent routine for my daily activities. A routine helps me settle and feel comfortable. My kennel is my favorite place to be because I feel safe there. I am kennel trained, know my name, and will tell you when I have to go potty once a routine is established. - Yeti From Yeti's Foster Mom: \"Yeti is a happy, but scared 11 month old puppy. She is very talkative when she needs something and will let you know, i.e. when she needs to go potty. Yeti is a very smart, curious and capable pup that needs special attention and care from the right forever home. We have been fostering her for around 5 months and she is just starting to feel comfortable enough to let us pet her on her own terms. She has taken to one of the adults in our house more than the other, so shes probably more of a one person dog than a family dog. Full disclosure: Yeti is not your typical I-love-everyone puppy. She will spend the first few weeks figuring out your space and your routines. She will avoid you and your presence for a long while and needs someone patient and willing to work extensively with her to build trust. Yeti acts like a normal playful puppy around other dogs, but when humans come around she is very timid and scared.\" Yeti's adoption fee will be $375 which includes her spay, vaccinations and any additional medical care she may have needed.",

Shes smart and food motivated, looking for a forever home. She is a busy girl that seeks out enriching activities, but LOVES humans. Humans are her jam. She would love a newly retired couple that has a thirst for adventure. She is learning how to be alone, but this has proven to be hard for her. She has discovered that cats are fun to chase. So no cats, or very dog savvy cats. She's not trying to hurt them, but will probably play (maybe too hard) with them. Shes nervous around new dogs but would benefit from a confident dog in her home to show her the ropes of dogging, but would be perfectly happy being an only dog again. Izzie's adoption fee is $375 which covers her spay, vaccinations appropriate at the time of adoption, microchip and any additional medical care she may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, are NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are.

A perfect day for him includes a large fenced yard to play in, a long afternoon nap, and lots of treats. Kobe has met and done well with respectful dog-savvy children. Kobe would prefer to be the only pet in the home and with a family who has breed experience. If your family loves the outdoors and is looking for a fun addition then you might be a match for Kobe! Kobe is fully vetted including vaccines, spay, microchip.\n\nKobe can scale fences with ease so a tall fenced yard and supervision is a must. He is a lover who only wants to give and receive unconditional love. \n\nALL children should be at least AGE 5 to be approved for adoption!\n\nFill out an application at our website below to be considered for adoption.  This dog is available in the TX Area.  We will contact you if we need further information.  We cannot directly reply to all applications.  \n\nPlease apply directly at WWW.BIGDOGRESCUEPROJECT.ORG/Adopt.\n\nApplications can be made at bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt.

            "description": "America is a sweet 12 year old Shepherd mix. She came to Labs and More needing some TLC and is recuperating in an experienced foster home. America is fostered with other dogs but wants her space from them. She likes to establish herself as top dog. She can be a bit particular in her old age and needs an adult only home. She likes her space when she eats both from other dogs and people, and she will need a home with prior dog experience. She is mellow and takes food from her hand gently. She is familiar with a leash and content with a few short walks each day. America is housetrained and will wait at an open door until she has permission to go outside. She is crate-trained and has no problem going in her kennel if you need her to. She also rides well in the car. If you're looking for a mellow, loyal senior dog to be your companion for the rest of their days, America may be the girl for you! Your interest in adopting a recued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org.

So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "This spunky boy with lots of love to give is Ezra! He is about 3 years old and a mix of Boxer and Dutch Shepherd. Ezra landed at Labs and More after being diagnosed with a heart murmur. While he has been cleared for adoption by our vets, he will require daily medication that keeps his heart beating at a regular pace and it may increase as he gets older. Ezra is a happy boy who loves to be by your side. He loves to play with dog toys and tennis balls, and has a great time at Fiesta Island with his foster family! However, he will not be a running partner or be a candidate for extended bouts of exercise due to his medical needs. Puzzles, games and mental exercises would be great ways to mentally challenge this smarty pants and wear him out. Ezra can be choosy with his dog friends but when he can social distance like at Fiesta Island, he does fine. He thinks kitties are for chasing and would do better in home with no children or children over the age of 10. Ezra is house trained and he needs a forever family that understands his condition and is willing and able to work with it to give him a happy and loved life. If you are interested in meeting Ezra, your first step is to submit an adoption application on our website today! If you are approved with an adoption coach or have adopted from us before, please reach out to your coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a recued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org.

So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

I am very shy and reserved until I get to know and trust you\u2026then I show you my silly side! My ideal home would have: \n-Previous dog experience as an adult (having a dog as a kid does not count). I will need someone that can help grow my confidence. \n-Patience \u2013 I will need you to go slow with everything so I feel at ease with all the new excitement! \n-No kitties \u2013 maybe another dog but I would prefer to be the focus of your attention at least for a while so we can bond!\n-Older kids only so everyone can participate in things such as training. I\u2019m also quite large and might accidentally knock down the little ones!\n-A home with a fenced yard would be AWESOME so we could play together.  \n\nApply online to learn more about me! www.marshmallowfoundation.org\nVisitors to the shelter are by appointment only and after an application has been submitted online.",

            "description": "Whitley is an Australian Cattle Dog of about 5 years and 50lbs. He needs a very heeler-savvy leader as his person. Whitley is very loyal and a total velcro dog to his people. People are his favorite, other dogs are his least favorite. He may have been attacked when he was younger which, in combination with a very dominant personality, leads him to be reactive to other dogs. He needs a home with a fenced back yard since he can't enjoy any other typical off-leash spots for dogs like dogs parks and doggy day cares. Whitley is very intense, is easily excitable and needs a home that wants to provide him a moderate-to-high amount of activity. Since he is food motivated, he is a great trainee and wants to please! Whitley is a typical velcro dog and wants to be by your side, always. He loves his person and just wants to find his forever companionship in a human. His ideal home is with his humans and no other dogs or a submissive dog. He is house trained and a total dream in the crate. He knows sit, down and shake. Whitley is neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and preventives, microchipped and heartworm-negative.",

This stubby dude is a total character, and we just know that he'll bring a lot of joy and laughter to his forever home.\n\nBooker is around 3-4 years old, he appears to be an Olde English Bulldogge/American Bulldog mix. He is very strong and will need an experienced handler, and may be best suited as an only dog or placed with a non-dominant female dog near his size in his new forever home. Booker loves to go for walks, he is potty trained and does not need to be kenneled when left alone in his foster home.\n\nBooker's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip, current vaccinations and preventatives PLUS a free obedience course at Cedar Run in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, be altered and current on vaccinations and preventatives. Our adoption process includes reference and background checks, a vet check and a home visit. Please submit an adoption application for consideration at www.Adopthope.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: GPMR communicates primarily by email. If you have any questions regarding one of our Mastiffs, please read their bio and if you still have questions- drop us an email at info@greatplainsmastiffrescue.org . If you have questions about our adoption procedures, please go to our Pages of Interest on the left hand column under 'Adoption Info.' We answer email inquiries almost immediately-usually always within a few hours and phone calls are returned with 24-36 hours.\n\nGPMR does not have a shelter. All of our dogs are kept in loving foster homes. We must have a completed adoption\napplication on file before meeting any of our mastiffs.\n\nGPMR adopts to the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana and parts of Colorado.\n!!!Any mastiffs being adopted out of the state of Oklahoma require a health certificate to be paid for by the adopter!!!\n\nWillow is part of our 'Fall in Love' adoption special and has a reduced adoption fee of $225.Meet Willow! She came into GPMR when her owner had to go through cancer treatment and wasn't able to keep her. She lived with that family since a puppy and she was terrified and confused when she first arrived into rescue. We don't think she was mistreated at all but it's clear she never left her home very much and so new situations are very scary for her. She gets so scared that she will urinate in fear at the vet's office, which makes us feel so bad for her.Willow is almost 5 years old. She is great with other dogs but does not like to share her food bowl, so she just needs to be fed by herself. Other than that she does great, and is curious about cats but not enough to investigate. The ideal home for Willow would be a quiet, adult only home, she is scared of children and the noises that come along with having little ones. Willow's family needs to patient with her and understand that she will take several weeks to adjust in her new home. She loves her crate and that's where she goes when she is worried about something. She is house trained as well and is very well behaved indoors. When she goes outside she likes to do her business and come right back inside. She is definitely a homebody and not a good match for someone who wants a Mastiff they can bring places with them. She much prefers to be home rather than out and about.Willow was adopted to a single woman and then returned 8 months later when the woman developed health issues and was no longer able to care for Willow. We were so sad for both of them! Since Willow has been back, she's done really well adjusting back into her foster home. We're proud that she was able to go to a new home and then come back, without having any major setbacks. We know her forever home is out there!Willow was recently diagnosed with partially torn ACL's in both knees. One side has been like that a while and the specialist said likely injured it long before we got her. The other side is a recent injury and we've opted to try a brace on the knee instead of surgery. It should arrive soon and from talking with other Mastiff owners, they've seen really good results with it.Willow is being fostered in Guthrie, OK.Save a Mastiff...Adopt, Foster, Volunteer!",

            "description": "\n\nHey there, it\u2019s Polar! Yes, I\u2019m back with Moonsong. You might remember my story, I came a loooong distance to Moonsong from a shelter in Alabama back in 2018.  You see I had tested positive for heart worm and none of the rescues in that area had room for me. Lucky for me Moonsong didn\u2019t let me down, they sent their amazing volunteer who they call Superman to my rescue!  He drove many, many miles to come save me and transported me to Wyoming and then I hitched a ride to Boise, Idaho.    What a journey!  And the great news is my heart worm treatment was successful, so I\u2019m just on a routine preventive.\n\nI got adopted to a nice lady and move to Oregon for a bit. I loved my time in my new home. Unfortunately, my prey drive got the better of me and I got into a bit of trouble. Because of my prey drive, absolutely no home with cats, small dogs or other small pets will be an option for me. \n\nBeing a teenager, I\u2019m a high energy boy and like to pull and be out front on walks. I\u2019m learning about loose leash walking, impulse control and lots of other fun stuff with the force free trainers who work with me. I know basic commands like how to sit and lay down. I\u2019m pretty easy to train because I LOVE food! I\u2019m really strong and would love to learn how to skijor and bikejor. I just need a little training. My perfect family is active and would continue my force free training.\n\nI get super excited when I see other dogs during walks \u2013 I just want to go meet them! I have been in play groups in the past and I really liked that! With careful introductions I get along with the other dogs my size and just ignore anyone trying to start trouble.\n\nI am house-trained and have been told that I\u2019m like a cat because I love attention and close contact. I can be a big lap dog! If you\u2019re up for adopting a sweet, active, handsome Malamute, please get in touch with my \u201cagent\u201d below!\n\nNote: Because Polar is leash reactive, his owner must have the physical strength to manage him.  Polar needs a family with previous experience with Malamutes that is willing to take the time to continue his force free training.\n",

We rescued the entire litter when they were seven months old and in dire need of saving. We have the before pictures.    Jade and Jewel are loving and affectionate dogs, they love other dogs, Jade is friendly to children. Jewel is actually afraid of kids. Never exposed to cats. \n\nThe ideal home for this pair of dogs, is a mature couple that\u2019s looking for a pair of companion animals to come home to. They\u2019ve never been socialized to dog parks or riding in the car, but they will happily greet you and love you every day the rest of your life. Jewel thinks she\u2019s a lap dog. We love these two dogs. They live in a foster home the way companion animals should. They are crate trained, housetrained, Sweet, and thrive on a consistent schedule. They are heavy chewers so we have a good supply of antlers, elk horns, and other natural chews available.  \n\nNo behavioral issues, just shy of strangers, but sweethearts. \n\n Jade and Jewel are spayed, up-to-date on all vaccines, microchip, and they receive monthly preventatives. \n\n We prefer that this pair of dogs stay somewhat local to the Birmingham area. Jefferson, Shelby County, Bibb, Chilton, Montgomery countries are not too far.  We look forward to speaking to anyone seriously interested in adopting this nice pair of dogs. \n\nEmail for an application. were4dogs@gmail.com",

            "description": "Look at this beautiful girl! This is Mia. Mia is a Boxer and American Staffordshire Terrier mix. Mia is around 2 years old. She was dumped off in a busy park and left to fend for herself. She kept running up to people wanting to play. She's very friendly and loving. One of our foster mom's neighbors saw her and offered Mia a ride. Mia was more than happy to accept and jumped into the car and off they went. :) The neighbor rode around trying to find her owners but with no luck. She was taken to the vet and scanned for a microchip but there was none. She was reported to the shelter and posted in all of the lost and found groups yet no one came forward. We can't imagine why because this girl is a total sweetheart!\n\nWe are now trying to find a forever home for Mia. Mia weighs 52 lbs. She is awesome with people and other dogs. She has lots of energy and loves to run and play. She can also be relaxed and calm. Mia would do best in a home with children 10 years old and older. She would do great in a home that has another dog that likes to play. She would do great in an active household. She must go to a home with a fenced in yard. Mia would be an awesome addition to any family.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Mia please email fureverangels@aol.com for an application.",

Perhaps he was hunting and didn't do well and was left behind, or maybe someone just didn't want him anymore.  We are here to change that for him and get him into a home where he can become the sweet companion that hounds can be.  He is very strong and has no leash manners, but he is learning and will get better with that.  He will definitely need a fenced yard to allow him his \"sniffing\" time and to allow him the time to relax while casing the yard.  He is very gentle and would do super with a family with kids. \n\nIf you would like an application go to our website and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations. If you would like an adoption application, please send an email message to adoptprebleco@yahoo.com",

Angus is one of those dogs who thrives once he has some consistency and guidance. When he first arrived at the shelter, he was so afraid that he would hide under his bed. But after lots of positive interactions, Angus learned that the staff and volunteers were there to help him and take care of him. He definitely has his enthusiastic moments but he calms with appropriate redirection, and focus games are his jam! Angus loves toys and one of his favorite things to do is select a toy from the toy bin and then throw it around in the air. Yippee! Angus is always super excited to make friends. Hey new person, are you my fren? Yes! What about you, mister, you my fren, too? Ok! And that person over there not looking at me, can they also be my fren? Yay! Angus is also very dog social and enjoyed going to play group at the shelter. We think he would love to live with a doggy friend, or go on regular play dates! We know from his time in foster that Angus is house trained and crate trained. He walks nicely on a leash and wants to sniff allllll the things! Angus is still a youngin so he sometimes decides to chew on stuff he is not supposed to, but he trades nicely for a treat or an appropriate toy. Angus would do well in most home environments but we would not recommend young kiddos since he can sometimes get jumpy/mouthy when he is excited. I weigh approximately 57 lbs.

Millie and Major came in together and are a bonded pair but they need to be the only 2 dogs in the house. They are both super sweet and loving. They both get along great with all people. Not good with cats. Real cuddle bugs that walk well on a leashs. They eat out of the same bowl and run to each other for kisses when they are separated for any length of time. If you can find it in your heart to adopt 2 please let us know by PM or email us at: info@bigdogrescue.com. Thanks.\nMajor the Blue nose is about 2 years old and Millie the Red nose is 4 yrs.",

She would benefit greatly with a training class with OUR trainer which we will provide.\n\nFilling out an application is the first step in the adoption process. If you have questions, the best way to contact us is to email azdesertrottis@aol.com.\n\nWe don't always bring all animals to our adoption events so check ahead of time to make sure the animal you are interested in is still available. Some animals listed may already be promised.\n\nArizona Desert Rotti & Pals Rescue is a NO KILL rescue serving Tucson and the surrounding area. \n\nWe do adopt out of area under the right circumstances. If you are willing to travel to Tucson to meet us, and to personally transport your adopted pet home, we may be willing to work with you. \n\nA home visit is usually required for the safety of our animals. We check the yard to make sure this little pup cannot escape, no predator can get in, and also look for hazardous plants. \n\nWe do not adopt our dogs out unless you have a secured, fenced yard, it\u2019s a requirement for the safety of the dog. At the end of the application, please include the type of fencing and the height of the fence you have around your yard. \n\nIf you're interested in Mina or any of our dogs, please fill out a pre application at: http://www.azdesertrotti.com/html/to_adopt.htm\nOnce you have filled out the pre-adoption application, someone will contact you about the dog to answer your questions and tell you where our Sunday adoption event is held.\n\nOur dogs are bathed, dewormed, vet checked, given their required shots, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. \n\nOur rescues are homed with foster parents. They are fostered in homes so that we can tell you a little bit about their personalities, feeding schedule, habits, behavior, whether they get along with other dogs. We can tell you if they are crate trained, if they are leash trained and house trained. Most dogs need a refresher course on potty training when they go to a new home. They need to learn your routine, and it will be up to you to teach them. \n\nEven the most abused animals can be wonderful pets. It takes patience, love and good food, along with fun and commitment to the animal. Fosters work with these animals. They are a part of our families, while we are lucky enough to have them.",

            "description": "Torta is a 6 year old female Pekingese rescued from a puppy mill.\nShe has been terrified of her own shadow for a long time. She loves to run around outside with all the dogs and bark at birds and the others but human touch is not something she enjoys. She has been groomed but wasn't an easy task. We are holding her every single day like it or not and believe she is coming around to love. We have finally seen the crowning glory of her tail coming up and curling over her back. She goes potty outside and has used a potty pad inside.\n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA. \n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

He LOVES to play but can also be quite the couch potato at times! He can be a little shy with introductions but once he knows you, hell beg you for head scratches! Theyre his favorite, youve been warned! Batman gets along well with other doggos, kids and even cats! Since he is still working on his leash skills, he requires a home with a fenced yard. This pupper is house trained and crate trained! Batman is very routine oriented, down to how he gets in and our of the house. Please know that he does have chronic ear infections. He will need a loving and caring home who will care for his adorable ears properly. \n\nThe adoption fee for this handsome boy is $225. He has been neutered, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines!\n\nWant to meet Batman? Submit an adoption application and someone will be in touch to schedule a meet n greet to see if hes the right match for you!",

The rain washed away all the familiar scents and she was unable to navigate home. Poor little thing waited for her family to save her, but no one ever came. We rescued Maeve and had her examined by our vet. She has a heart murmur, and the vet started her on medication. Maeve is a very loving little dog, loves to cuddle and sit by your side. Although she is blind, she quickly learned her foster mom's home and yard and navigates just fine. We believe she can still see light and dark. Maeve is happy, friendly and very devoted. She would be the perfect dog for someone who is lonely or retired. Maeve gets along well with her foster siblings, is house triained, spayed and fully vaccinated. Maeve would love to spend her golden years in a loving safe home. Adopting a senior dog is one of the most rewarding things you can do. They are so grateful and shower you with love. These amazing dogs deserved better than the lives they had before, and you can make a difference!

            "description": "Meet Bubba!  \nBubba is approximately a 2 year old neutered mix of a boy! The most popular guesses have been Boxer, English bulldog, mastiff, rottie combinations.  DNA results are pending so time will soon tell!  For now we just know he is a cutie!  Check out the pics and his nubby tail video to see for yourself!\nIn Bubba\u2019s short life he has spent several months in a shelter only to be adopted and returned 2 different times.  While Bubba LOVES being with his people, he doesn\u2019t really care for people in his personal space.  He is a bossy boy who likes to take charge and can sometimes be rude and demanding.  If Bubba doesn\u2019t want to do something or doesn\u2019t like you doing something he will let you know it.  Sometimes that means jumping on you, sometimes that means being mouthy and/or pawing at you.   Bubba needs a calm, confident, strong leader who is willing to love him, give him personal space and establish boundaries for acceptable behavior.  Bubba needs to be trained to understand he is NOT in charge and it is NOT OK to jump and/or be mouthy.\nBubba is a super star in his crate.  He sits calmly, does not bark and will willingly \u201cgo to his house\u201d any time he is instructed to do so.  He loves toys!  Plush toys, chew toys, rope toys, bone toys\u2026any toy will do and Bubba does a great job entertaining himself with his very large toy collection.  Bubba is already potty trained, crate trained, and sits perfectly for his treats and will sit and wait for his food. \nThe ideal home for Bubba would be a low traffic home with adults who are willing to love and spend time with him while giving him personal space to be his happiest.    Because Bubba is so bossy, he will need an adopter who understands this and is willing to establish and continuously reinforce boundaries of acceptable behavior to help Bubba succeed.   We know Bubba will be a great companion for the right person/people.  We believe in Bubba so much that we have fully funded a contract with a trainer to help Bubba and his future foster/adopter adjust to a new life together.  Bubba will need to be a single dog and is not a fan of kitties.\nIf you are interested in adopting Bubba please visit www.zoeshouserescue.com and complete an application.   His adoption donation is $350",

            "description": "Carmelo came to us terrified of everything, and is in a foster learning to feel safe. It is going well but will take some time. She is not ready for adoption yet, but we wanted to keep her on the page to share her journey.\n\nDay 1 (April 10): Carmelo arrives at her foster home and her kennel is set up inside of a pen - her own safe spot to unwind without interference.\n\nDay 2 (April 11): Carmelo ventured out overnight for a meal. Today she stuck her front bits out for kibble and water. She also played subtle peek a boo with her foster mom through her cage door. Those ears! Have you ever seen a grander pair?\n\nDay 3 (April 13): She finally shows herself! Not for long. but more than yesterday. And her foster mom got to pet her a little inside her crate. She's ever watchful through those holes in the side.\n\nDay 4 (April 14): Carmelo's foster mama thinks this new arrangement is great! It gives Carmelo a more open view of life outside the crate (which involves lots of harmless animal love). She's not as sure. Her foster mom shut the crate but didn't lock it and Carmelo seemed to relax some. Plus Carmelo will feel independent when she pushes it open. In theory anyway!\n\nDay 5 (April 15): Little sweetness made it out of her crate. She still doesn't want to be touched. But at least she's out watching her foster family (her foster mom, mostly). She's still matching the appetite of a dog much larger than herself - the poor thing must have been starved.\n\nProgress every day. We can't wait until she trusts her foster mom enough to come out and interact! We'll let you know when the time comes!\n\nIf interested in Carmelo, please complete our application at our website here: https://lastchanceatlife.org/adoptable-pets/dog-adoption-application/ 1/30/21 10:58 PM",

Raven is a sweet and skiddish dog who takes time to warm up to a new person. She does not react aggressively to new people just shy. She reacts best to men. Raven does not like to walk on a leash as it is nerve wracking for her to explore new places. She does enjoy going outside in a fenced in area that she is comfortable in. She is potty trained, but only to go outside in a yard, she will not go on a leash. Raven is obessed with a big hard plastic ball that she plays with. She also loves to chase a tennis ball (not so great at bringing it back though)!. Please fill out an application to meet her!",

ALL DOGS LISTED ARE AVAILABLE.\n\nLook at this beautiful boy! Buford is a Parvo survivor (no worries about him ever getting it a second time!) who is now healthy and looking for his forever home.\n\nBuford is a year old, approximately 20 lbs, and okay with most dogs (although he prefers female dogs and does not like large male dogs) and cats.\n\nHe's a little shy when he meets new people but he takes just a minute or two to warm up and then he's ready to be your buddy. He's got lots of energy, but is also a snuggler. Buford would be fine in a home with a dog friend (he's fine tolerating most other dogs but is unlikely to be a play mate to another dog), or would be just as happy being showered with all of the attention.\n\n* Just turned a year old\n\n* Neutered, vaccinated, micro chipped and UTD on both flea and heartworm prevention.\n\n* Not recommended for a home with children\n\n* Does not like large male dogs\n\n* Okay with dog savvy cats but tends to bully cats who are less dog savvy.\n\n* Adopters must live within 2 hours of Florence, KY. Unfortunately, we cannot make exceptions\n\n* $212.00 Adoption fee\n\n** Not appropriate for a home that shares walls with neighbors (no apartments or condos)\n\nHis listing will be removed as soon as he has an approved application\n\nIf you have specific needs that aren't addressed in the bio (children in the home, small animals, apartment/condo living, etc) please email to ask if the dog is suitable for the environment before submitting an application. Once the application is submitted, please expect someone to email you with questions and/or provide more information about the dog is we are unsure that the dog may be a good fit.\n\nMost importantly, please be honest! We have many people tell us what they think we want to read, not what's truthful. If there are discrepancies, your application will be denied. It's important for us to place dogs in a home that's suitable. You may be a stellar owner but possibly not a good fit for the dog you were first interested in adopting. We're not trying to offend anyone, we're trying to set everyone up for success. We're a best fit rescue and will verify your vet and personal references.\n\nAdoption Process:\n\nStep 1: Complete a \"no obligation\" application on our website, www.pawprintsnky.com\n\nStep 2: PawPrints will review the application, verifying Vet and personal references as well as landlord requirements/restrictions (if applicable)\n\nStep 3: IF your application is approved, we will call you to schedule a meet and greet for you to meet the pet.\n\nStep 4: If the meet and greet goes well, we will schedule the home visit.",

She can play rough so she would not be ideal for older dogs or tiny breeds as a companion. Penny weighs around 60 to 65lbs.  She is protective, affectionate and loving with her humans but also independent.  She is spayed, vaccinated, dewormed, and microchipped.  She has a low to medium energy level and would love to be a couch potato or play.  Because of her picky temperament, she might be best as an only dog.\n\nIf you are interested in any of our pets, please include some details about your household (number of adults, children, pets, and community you are in). We drive to all of our adopters homes with the pet to meet the whole family. We do not operate a kennel. Please provide some details about your experience in raising pets. If your email only asks if the pet is still available, you will not receive a reply.\n",

My previous owners didn't take care of my allergies so my skin is a little tender in places right now and I'm missing some fur there.

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 7/5/2019\nReason for being in rescue: found as a stray in SC\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? none noted\nWeight: est 50 lbs\n\nHeight: est 17\" at the shoulder\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? We are seeking a home with an experienced dog owner and someone who is home more than they're away. Bixby needs another confident dog in the home. He is very active and needs a family that can provide the physical and mental stimulation that a young dog needs. Bixby is not for a first time dog owner.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Bixby is a happy, sweet pup! He is a very smart puppy and learns things very quickly. He has done excellent with his house training! He lives with many other dogs of all shapes and sizes and gets along well with all of them. He would love to have another dog in the home to play with and keep him company. Bixby would probably do best with another dog similar in size and stature as he likes to play rough sometimes. Bixby is currently working on his leash training and goes for walks three to four times a week. Bixby has also gone on off leash trail walks in the woods and absolutely loves it! He stays with his foster brothers and sisters and doesn't go out of sight. Bixby would be a great addition an active family looking for a young dog.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Bixby can be nervous meeting new people. Once he warms up he is all yours.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Bixby's estimated birthday is 3/13/2019.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

I like other things like food and rolling in the grass, but nothing comes close to my love of simply relaxing. I had a hard start to life. My puppies and I were living under a house. We were taken in by the reacue and I underwent heartworm treatment. I am happy to be HW- now. It took a while to trust people. I am happiest when I have my humans close by, but not necessarily touching me. I just like to relax knowing they are there. Dislikes: thunder, fireworks, being cold, too much affection (I'm shy and still learning to accept love), dominant female dogs, and the sound of motorcycles and 4-wheelers.\n\nMy adoption fee is $200 Houston area or $550 for out of state (includes adoption fee, health certificate, and transport fees.

He is one of those big 'mooshie' boys who loves life. He seems very cooperative and wants to please. The volunteers described him as a 'real gentleman.' Petey is 2 years old and cat workable in that he was interested in the cat but could be corrected and distracted away from the cat. Any greyhound needs this type of interaction to learn to live successfully with a cat.\nPetey is not ready for adoption yet as he has a broken leg and is recuperating from surgery.",

Suspicious for soft tissue injury. Patient displayed concerning behavior during examination including growling after repeated attempts to mount nurse. Concerned for behavioral decline in shelter. (3/9) Initial Exam - Unable to check mouth due to behaviorBehavior Observation: (4/19) Easy to leash, approached front of kennel with soft body. Moderate pulling on leash. Once outside he became frustrated that he could not go into the front parking lot and began mounting my leg. I used the fence as a tie out and was able to make some distance where he could not mount. He continued to attempt to mount for about 3 minutes until he was distracted by a smell and I was able to redirect his attention and we could start walking again. No issues returning to the building or kennel.(4/16) Initially baring teeth when kennel is approached, followed by a snap. Treat offered and snapped again, but then realizing it was a treat, stopped, and ate quickly off ground. Low growled while visiting dog in kennel nextdoor, handler turned and offered another treat. Dog's body language significantly loosened and interaction was ended. Came back to kennel some time later, and dog stood at front of kennel, slightly stiff. Was able to offer treat, then open kennel door and loop with no issue. Pulls moderately on leash while outside. Appeared nervous with excessive activity on campus and other dogs in area, so took dog to covered run. Dog stayed by gate door and scratched. Would come when called but then immediately go back to gate door. Walked nicely with minimal pulling back inside the building, and went into Evaluation Room. Sought attention from handler and allowed slow petting. Played with a stuffed toy but quickly lost interest. Easily brought back to kennel and allowed lead to be removed without issue.(4/15) Artica approaches front of kennel with a soft body and sits, easy to leash, pulls moderate on leash. Once in the play yard he paws at the gate to exit with ears back, lip licking. Outside the yard he allows handling and will solicit attention from handler with ears back, tail down, mouth closed. Easily goes back into kennel.(4/13)Per previous owner - active, sensitive, nervous, aggressive to strangers, hyperactive, great with cats, comes when calls, aggressive around toys, jumps on people, destructive-scratches/digs, snaps at people, aggressive around toys, affectionate great dog just randomly decides to \"switch up and attack.\"(3/13) Per Vet Staff -- Very friendly initially. Growled when examining his shoulder. After repeated attempts to mount nurse, patient began growling while attempting to mount and examination was discontinued This animal is currently available through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs.

With proper nutrition and insulin shots Ming quickly gained back her weight and strength. Given surgery to remove the cataracts Ming regained her full eyesight and now has perfect vision! She is super sweet, loves attention, and having her head and face stroked. Ming gets along with most animals with slow introductions, and would do best in a calm home with older children where she can just hang out. Ming requires daily insulin shots and weekly eye drops.

He's very calm with other dogs and loves people after he's gotten the time to get to know him. He's not a fan of the crate, but he behaves well when you leave the house. He is completly house broken, and has most basic training skills down. His main goal in life is to protect and love you every way that he can. Seriously... have we mentioned the snuggling?\n\nManny would love a sibling of any size, but not small children as he is a terrier and loves to jump and could spook someone by accident. He also has shown signs of interest when it comes to agility. Manny is about 60 pounds\n\nCan you help this delightful gentleman on the way to his forever home?

I've only been in my foster home a few days but so far it's ok. Everyone here has been very nice and they don't mind if I'm 12 years old. Mom rubs my belly and tells me I'm a good boy. She reminds me to go outside and do my business like the other guys. I'm trying really hard to do it right. I take naps on the couch and sometimes we play. Mom says I can stay until the right family finds me. I hope my new family likes to snuggle and will love me unconditionally. A soft bed and a warm blanket would be nice too!

            "description": "If we could describe Socks in 5 words we'd say: Loyal. Obedient. Friendly. Loving. Goofball...(Yes GOOFBALL! or is goof ball 2 words? either way he is one) Since the day he came to us, all 65-70 lbs of Socks has been a barrel of fun. He loves to cuddle and give friendly kisses any chance he can. He is the sweetest, most loving dog that just wants to be shown love from a devoted owner. He'd love you to take him on walks and give him lots of belly rubs. And he'll never ever turn down the opportunity to play fetch. Socks walks well on a leash, knows sit, wait, place command and likes to please. Socks is looking for an owner that will show him as much love as he is always willing to give. With structure, consistent rules and discipline, Socks is a joy to have around. Socks is around ten years old, black male, pitbull lab mix, neutered with all of his shots and potty trained. He needs to be the ONLY dog in the house, no cats and prefers one on one attention rather than the overwhelming hubbub of dog parks. \n\nSocks: male, black and white, 65 lbs, Lab Mix (mixed with pitbull maybe but his records state lab mix), up to date on his shots, neutered, chipped, fully trained and 9 1/2 years old.\n\nSocks is the perfect family dog that is fully trained. He is extremely submissive to people (He can shy and bows down to you upon meeting) and is extremely eager to please. He does yearn to have all the attention on him since he can be a bit territorial when it comes to other pets. Therefore, he should be the only pet in the home.\n\nHe knows how to use the doggy door and he hasnt had a single accident inside ever. He is great in car rides and does well on a leash. He is not destructive and is really only interested in toys and treats but knows not to beg for food. If his age might be a concern, he is energetic and LOVES being playful..for active families, he will fit right in! He is great with children.\n\nHe is a low maintenance dog, super calm and really just wants to be next to his human relaxing and cuddling much of the time. His coat is silky and shiny and he does not shed much. He is not a messy boy, not a digger or has any bad habits. \n\nHe is a great addition to any family because he is so quick to adjust! He has deep brown eyes that penetrate your soul and he gives all his trust and love to you the moment he meets you. Give this gentle and very loyal boy a chance.",

We had to get a trapper for her and now she is learning how to be an inside dog and how to get treated with kindness. Lanna is currently working on potty training. She is about 3 years old and weighs 11lbs. \n\nLanna is scared and shy of new people, however, she is very treat motivated. Her new adopter will have to understand they will need to be patient with her and work with Lanna to gain her trust. Lanna will happily accept your love in exchange for a treat!\n\nLanna does not like to walk on a leash. Therefore, no apartments. She must go to a home with a backyard.\n\nShe loves other dogs and is very playful. Lanna would do best in a home with another dog who can show her the ropes. Because she is scared of people we would recommend a quiet home without a lot of visitors and with children over 12 years of age. Lanna is crate trained. She has not met a cat but can be cat tested upon request.",

            "description": "Poppy is a sweet yet nervous girl who needs help feeling comfortable with new things. Poppy loves to play with balanced dogs and typically does not have a problem with most dogs but does not mix well with fearful dogs as herself. Poppy does not mix well with other fearful dogs. She tends to digress in those packs. She does well around people she knows and gets nervous around new people. The key is to use some structure to allow her some time to feel comfortable. She does best when she is in the background and when you split her focus in uncomfortable situations. I usually use her canine friends, walks, and sometimes muzzles to speed up the time she needs to feel comfortable. She is a great girl and loves attention. She has spent lots of time with children here. It took a little time for her to be comfortable with them. Now she loves them all and looks forward to their affection. Poppy needs an environment that allows her time to get comfortable. She also needs someone that advocates for her. She loves exercising and would love to walk at least 4 days a week. She does not need to walk too far. Most walks that are a mile or less do the trick for her. Poppy loves to chase and be chased by her canine friends. She also loves to wrestle with trusted canine friends. She loves to chew bones and toys. Poppy also loves to have a dog bed. Regular exercise and activity stops that. Poppy walks very nicely but can get nervous enough to react when some people walk by. Poppy tends to warm up to women faster than men. Poppy's dream day would include some play time, affection, and lots of nap time. She loves to just hang out and nap with the group.",

She is 7 years old and weighs about 65lbs. The only reason she needs a new home is because her only owner had to go into the hospital for a long time and there was no one left to care for her. She is an excellent family dog. She does very well with small children and multiple children. She is slow to introduce to other dogs, but does very well once we settles in. She currently live with one large and one small dog ( plus another foster puppy). She is not cat tested. \n\nShe wants to be with her person all the time and she loves to hang her head out the car window on rides. She is crate trained, kennel trained, house trained and walks well on a leash. She is very quiet in the house once she settles into a routine. Carly like to spend her days lounging on her oversized ottoman. She is a great dog that is super sweet and would love to have a forever person.",
