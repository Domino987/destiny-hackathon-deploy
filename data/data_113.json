I am sweeter than actual pancakes though. Giving kisses should be my profession. I love to follow females around, I get nervous when I first meet men. If men are patient and earn my trust I will be their big baby. I love going outside but, must have a really tall fence. I am an athlete and will clear it. I\u2019d prefer to be walked on a leash and wouldn't be great in an apartment. Actually, I\u2019d rather go for a run. I get one daily right now and I will beg you for it. I\u2019d prefer someone who will take me on adventures. I love car rides and being outdoors. I am kennel and potty trained. I must sleep with you at night because I'm such a good snuggler. I also really LOVE little humans. I follow kids everywhere and love to be next to them as much as I can. Do you have some of those? I can't wait to meet you. I get nervous around other dogs. I need to be the only dog in the house, unless there is a dog that is very submissive, and you don\u2019t mind putting in work. I want a family that can be patient and understanding with me. I\u2019d like a family who will spend time teaching me new tricks and furthering my training.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Pancake, please fill out an application via our website at https://therescueproject.net/adoption-application and we will get back to you via email once your application has been reviewed. If you have further questions please feel free to reach out to us at adoptionstrp@gmail.com\n\nPancake's adoption fee is $200.  This includes age-appropriate vaccines, spay/neuter, microchip, deworm, heartworm testing.\n \n",

It\u2019s super important that my forever family understands me, and why I do the things that I do.  The people at the Bullpen are very serious about this, and will not consider applications from unqualified individuals.  \n\n3.\tLike many dogs of my breed, I can be wary of strangers, and I need to be introduced to new people and visitors slowly.   A busy house is NOT for me.\n\n4.\tI have met some of the other Bullpen dogs, and I don\u2019t mind them too much.  If introduced appropriately, I think I would do well in a home that had a large, laid-back female dog (but I also wouldn\u2019t mind being the only pet in the home).\n\n5.\tSince I came to rescue, I haven\u2019t spent much time in the company of smaller dogs, but I might be able to live in a house with medium to large sized dogs. My new family just needs to make sure we have a gradual, proper introduction. \n\n6.\tI am interested in the barn cats at the sanctuary in all the wrong ways.  A feline-free home would be the best fit for me.  \n\n7.\tI haven\u2019t had much experience with kids, but I\u2019m pretty sure I could live in a home with teenage children, as long as they weren\u2019t too loud or rambunctious.\n \n8.\tI love to spend time outside, eat bones, play with toys, and sleep on the bed with my foster dad! \n\n9.\tI am housebroken, crate-trained, good on a leash, and I also know basic commands!\n\n10.\t I am current on vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm negative, and neutered.  \n\nReady to give RC the forever home of his dreams?  Fill out our Adoption Application, located at www.bullpenrescue.org under the 'work with us' tab.\n\n**We highly recommend that our potential adopters fill out an online application as soon as possible, as it greatly expedites the process of finding the right dog for your situation.  \n\nOur dogs are available for adoption nationwide but preference is given to adopters willing to do an in-person meeting.  Please understand that our dogs are not adopted on a first-come, first-serve basis, but rather we strive for a \"perfect placement\" so we know that they will not be failed again.**\n",

Jase was full of playful energy and ready for fun-and-games during his photo session.  Thanks to Jon McIntire for spending time with Jase so that we could take his photos for his Petfinder/Facebook debuts.\n\nJase weighs 81.4 lbs and is very strong on the other end of leash.  He would do best with an experienced handler.\n\nJase has already been neutered.\n",

LOL. left to die in a Sacramento pound, scared out of his mind with infected eyes, horrible skin and other assorted sadnesses this little man is on his way to trusting more and allowing people to pet and hold him. Right now, he prefers to be a little devil but he loves to sleep with his owners and loves car rides. Taz for now is a sanctuary dog but for the right patient and caring person, he might be fun.  He is a fascinating dog and has been here now for quite some time and we could share many things about Taz. He has only a couple stubs for teeth (if that) so he is less likely to hurt when frightened.  He is a tough little street fighter and I think always will be.  Please contact us to adopt or sponsor.",

            "description": "THOR - A Handsome, Strong, and Loyal German Shepherd\n\n\nCan a name 'fit' a dog? We think so in Thor's case. He is a handsomely rugged pure bred adult German Shepherd dog. Thor has a strong personality and lots of energy. Thor enjoys the outdoors, especially going on hikes or even better a nice fenced in backyard to fetch and just have a fun time.  \n\nThor is very friendly and loyal to the volunteers at Sedona Shepherd. While in our care and at our facility, Thor is comfortable greeting new people, and generally will ignore well mannered large dogs. We keep Thor well socialized and he is comfortable meeting new adults and older children. \n\nIn his prior home, after settling in nicely, Thor did become protective of the household and needed to be properly introduced to visitors.  Once proper introductions are made Thor will accept visitors into a home, especially if they want to play fetch with him. Thor can walk nicely on a leash, though he is strong and when starting out likes to pull. Generally, if another dog ignores Thor, he will do the same. \n\nThor will flourish in a home with no other animals and an experienced German Shepherd owner. He is trustworthy in a house, smart, well trained and is looking to bond with his new best friend. We estimate Thor to be about 7 years old.  Because Thor did have a bite incident two years ago when a contractor was visiting his home, he will be adopted out on a bite contract.\n\nAt this time we are looking for a foster to adopt situation with Thor.  He has developed an allergy and anti-resistant infection in his ear canal.  Thor will be having an ear ablation surgery on his left ear, covered fully by Sedona Shepherd and our wonderful donors.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Any foster/adopter MUST have prior German Shepherd experience, must live either in New Jersey, eastern PA or Southern NJ and have no other animals in the house. We will not respond to any inquires that do not meet the above requirements. Thor is an amazing dog who needs to be in the best environment for him.\n\n\nSedona Shepherd Sanctuary's mission is to rescue adult and senior German Shepherd and mixes and find them loving homes. All of our dogs are fully vetted, up to date on all their shots\n\nOur adoption area includes New Jersey, Delaware Valley, Manhattan, Southern New York. We may adopt to Connecticut depending on circumstances. Please visit our website at www.sedonashepherd.com.\n\nSedona",

Marcos is a highly motivated and photogenic guy hoping to find someone who will help continue his training and help him practice all his amazing skills. Marcos is a graduate of a very prestigious board and train program where he learned things like loose-leash walking, sit, down, stay, wait, leave it, bed (place), settle, and recall (come when called). Marcos is very playful but is sometimes unaware of his size and strength. A home with children is probably not the best fit for him. His playful and fun-loving nature needs to be balanced by structure and boundaries. His excellent obedience is the perfect vehicle for the required structure. Marcos needs a confident handler, willing to show him what is expected and then hold him accountable to those expectations. Marcos tends to make impulsive decisions, as do most dogs, so an emphasis on impulse control (through the use of the wait and place commands) will be a must. Marcos would prefer to be the only dog in the home so that he and his new person can focus on continuing his training and building their relationship. However, Marcos is not reactive around other dogs when out and about on walks and such. Marcos will reward anyone willing to help him be the very best dog he can be with a lifetime of loyalty and friendship.\n\n* This dog is approved to live in Denver, however; BSL restrictions may apply in other cities/counties as applicable. Homeownership is required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Sparkle is a 5 \n year old Hound mix weighing 71 lbs. She ended up in the shelter and her previous owners failed her miserably by not reclaiming her. She likely wandered off due to living in a non secured yard/home. This gorgeous girl is already house and crate trained with very good house manners. Sparkle loves everyone she meets big and small, never meets a stranger but will need older kids . She is great with other large  dogs so she will do well with potential doggie family members. We do not recommend a home with cats as she is way too tempted to play chase with them. Sparkle's ideal home will include older kids and a doggie playmate. Sparkle will make your day warm, fuzzy, and of course 'sparkly' when she snuggles up with you on the couch letting you know how very much you are loved and adored. Foster mom says Sparkle likes to sleep right next to her in the bed...comfy and cozy. This adorable girl is eager to please and happy to learn. She has picked up on a few things like sit, down, and shake. Treats make it even better! She will require a secure tall  fenced in yard as she is pretty agile and may attempt to jump a  fence if something strikes her fancy (that would be her Hound genes at work). Foster mom tells us that this is the only bad habit or less desirable behavior she has seen in this otherwise wonderful young lady. She is a joy to be with and great company to have. Sparkle is already spayed, up to date on all vaccinations, current on preventatives, and micro chipped. The only thing missing from Sparkle's life is a forever home and a family who will keep her safe and love her always. She's a one of a kind gal who will be the sparkle in your eyes. No need to wish that she was yours... make it happen cuz there is just no better feeling in the world than having your best friend, Sparkle, by your side",

Chloe is an amazing companion in search of an equally amazing owner. This girl is healthy as can be and is used to exercising regularly. She loves the outdoors and is friendly with all people as well as kids. Chloe is good with other dogs, but just prefers they not be in her home. She enjoys a good romp at the dog park, but she's not looking for a sibling.\n\nChloe is house trained, crate trained and obedient. She even goes into her crate on command without a treat! She sits, lays down, rolls over and rarely barks. What a gem! This little lady is affectionate, mellow and just has an all around sweet personality. If you're looking for an easy dog to have around, you may have just found her!\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

She loves to go on walks or even play in the pool when the weather is nice enough. She is always for a game of fetch as she loves to play with her toys.\n\nShe is good with kids but due to my size she can sometime get a little too happy and forgets that she is a bigger dog. For that reason we believe she should be in a home with kids 10 years or older. She would prefer to be an only dog as sometimes she doesn\u2019t always like when other dogs get too close. She is good with other small submissive male dogs when properly introduced. \n\nShe is kennel and house trained. She is on a special urinary food and will need to be on that the rest of my life unless a veterinarian clears her. \n\nShe can go on a home visit with you for 1 week to make sure we are the perfect fit for each other. My adoption fee is $150 and includes up to date shots, heart worm test, microchip and spay. If interested in adopting Annie, send an email to adoptions.spspca@gmail.com",

            "description": "Scamper is a 4 year old, 39 pound beagle mix - probably got some cattle dog in him as well. Yellow and white with a little black. He was rescued from a shelter last year. He came in shy and still is a bit, but he has warmed up a lot. He's enjoyed meeting kids who visit, and he knows how to 'shake'. He loves getting treats and takes them nicely. He should open up even more in a home where he would have one on one attention.\nHe is house trained, however, we as say that all dogs need a refresher course at their forever homes. He is okay with other dogs.\nHe is fixed, is chipped, and is up to date on all his shots.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

            "description": "Grandma is a 9-year-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, 4dx/heartworm tested, and spayed/neutered. This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: We typically host weekly Saturday adoption events. In order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment. Appointments are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, private adoption appointments are only offered for individual animals.\n\nAs always, our foster homes are happy to speak to approved applicants prior to meeting up to ensure compatible matches. Furthermore, they are happy to accommodate video chat, text messages, pictures, etc. to reduce in-person contact.\n\nWhile our adoption appointment objects are thoroughly disinfected before and after use (writing pens, clipboard, tables), adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees can also be completed electronically (which is preferred). Private appointments will be scheduled in intervals to avoid large gatherings of people.***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

It takes me a few days to get used to a new human but if you are patient with me, I promise that you will receive so much love and happiness in return. I do require a house with a yard, as I LOVE being outside. Apply to be my furever home today.\n\nOur Furry Friendz are available for adoption through a screening process which includes but is not limited to: a completed application, 3 referrals, a home visit, and a vet referral prior to their furever home placement. The dogs are Spayed/Neutered, micro chipped, current on all vaccines and on heart worm/flea preventive. If you're interested in adopting, let's begin the Adoption process by clicking the link below.\n\n\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/FURF/Dog",

He has the fetch part down-he's working on the 'give it back' part but has done well with that also. :) He has pep in his step and wants to be a good boy.

She and her sister, STELLA,  need to find a new home together.  Stella and Pookie have lived together pretty much all their lives. Pookie is 8 yrs. old and is a great dog who will have you laughing with her ways and shining spirit.\n\nIf you can't adopt but are interested in fostering, please contact us ASAP.\n\nPookie and Stella are housetrained and are not big barkers.  They do fine home alone with each other for company once acclimated.  Stella, in particular needs someone who can get her out for walks/hikes, but Pookie loves a walk as well.  She's quite the explorer.  They also both love sitting on the couch with their person and watching TV.  Pookie is a little bit cautious when meeting new people, but warms up quickly.  Pookie loves pets and being held once she knows you. Pookie likes to bark at new dogs, but once she knows they're friendly, she's fine.  See STELLA's separate posting for more pictures of her. \n\nPOOKIE is gentle and sweet and a big fan of cuddles and kisses.  The girls have never lived with kids, but did live near a school and were fine with the kids, though Pookie's sister Stella could knock over a youngster with her exuberance.  Older kids should be fine.  They have never lived with a cat, so without is probably easiest.  Pookie and Stella would love to find a new home together, ideally with a yard as that's what they're used to.",

If you can't adopt but would be interested in fostering, please contact us ASAP.\n\nStella and Pookie had lived with the same family their whole lives until coming in to rescue.  They are housetrained, not big barkers, and friendly with people.  Stella is an active 9 yrs. old..  Stella can be strong and needs to work on her manners a bit, but really wants to please and actually listens quite well. She is a total love and a very happy girl who likes to chase after and chew on a ball when not cuddled up next to you.  She settles well with just regular walks and would like to find a family that can take her out for walks and maybe even an occasional hike. She likes to ride in the car. Stella is a beauty in both looks and spirit.  She exudes happiness.  She's done well with the other dogs she's met.  \n\nHer sister Pookie is a cute little one that only takes a minute to decide she'd like pets from you.  For more pictures, see POOKIE's separate posting. They both enjoy sitting on the couch and watching TV with their person.  Both are super cuddlers.\n\nStella and Pookie are looking for a home together.  These two have never lived with a cat, so a home without is probably best.  They have been around kids having lived near a school, and like them but Stella could knock over a very young child with her exuberance.  Older kids should be fine.

            "description": "Rocky's foster mom calls him Rockstar, and for good reason. He's a\nhandsome Llewellyn boy with a sweet face that will melt your heart.\nAnd like some rockstars, he does have his quirks. But we're sure that\nin the right home, 9 year young Rocky will flourish as a companion and family\nmember. He's house-trained, adores people and so wants to be adored in\nreturn. He is looking for a home where he has a female caretaker and his person will be around most of the time.\n\nHe's had a bit of a tough go. He was initially a hunting ranch reject. Hunting is definitely not his thing, he doesn\u2019t even really like to be outside for very long and he hates to get his feet wet. After the hunting ranch he was in a home for six years before he was released to SWESR because his family was not able or willing to deal with his skin allergies. His allergies are under control with diet and allergy medication.\n\nRocky\u2019s doggy social skills are not great. He requires controlled/slow intros with other dogs and is not a candidate for dog parks. He lacks confidence and would not be good in a home with dominate male dogs or sick/weaker dogs. He\u2019ll be best as an only dog or with a calm dog that leaves him alone. He is ok with inside cats, no outside cats.\n\nWhat Rocky most needs is a stable environment and consistent loving\nattention to help him realize that he's OK and that he belongs! He will always have some anxiety but after what he has been through, coupled with the sensitive nature of an English Setter, that is understandable. He is most comfortable with women and has a bit of a watch dog and retreat mentality, which means he will always bark when there is a car in the driveway or someone at the door. He often barks when his foster Dad enters the room where he is with his foster Mom, so any men in the home would have to be gentle and patient. No kids because of this anxiety and his desire for a calm home.\n\nRocky loves to snuggle and wiggles his gratitude for any attention. He is very excited on leash and pulls like a draft horse. He needs a strong and steady person to work on his leash skills with him. He would not be good in a home with elderly people. He needs a home with a fenced yard that is interesting for a Setter. Having the opportunity for regular exercise is key to Rocky's long-term happiness and health. He has moderate hip dysplasia, which is common for our breed, does not require surgery and does not slow him down one bit. He will be fine with 4 foot fencing.\n\nOne of Rocky's most distinctive features is how intensely he looks straight into your eyes and seems to ask \"will you love me?\" The person who says \"yes\" will have a fantastic new friend and companion for life if they are just patient with him.\n\nRocky is neutered, up to date on vaccines and tests, microchipped, and on heartworm preventative. He is in a foster home in Boerne, TX and is available for adoption in the Texas area.\n ?.  \n\nFor an application to adopt or for more information about Southwest English Setter Rescue including our adoption requirements and transport availability, please go to http://www.swesr.org/. Please call us at 214-997-3885 if you have any questions.",

EMAIL, STAFF@ARVSIMI.ORG, WITH CONTACT NUMBER AND CITY YOU RESIDE.  PLEASE BE PATIENT AS WE NAVIGATE THESE UNCHARTED WATERS.   We DO NOT adopt out of state. ***\n\nAnnie was born in approximately 2013.  She is a very sweet, affectionate dog who gets along with all other dogs.  She is mostly potty trained with the occasional accident.  She has had some tooth loss, and several teeth pulled at last dental.  We generally soak her kibble to make it easier for her to chew.  Annie is currently about 14.5 pounds.\n\nAnnie was rescued from the shelter.  Her owner had moved and left her with friends who did not want her so they passed her along to someone else, who also didn\u2019t want her and they left her outside, so they didn\u2019t have to deal with her.  Annie was good at escaping from their yard and would often be found wandering the neighborhood.  She was finally picked up by Animal Control and brought to the shelter.  Owners were contacted and relinquished Annie to the shelter.  It was then discovered that Annie had a severe heart murmur that would need to be evaluated by a veterinary cardiologist.  Annie\u2019s foster mom noticed Annie having frequent episodes that looked similar to seizures but were later diagnosed as heart disease.  Annie has a left Atrium leaky valve and an enlarged heart, which has been managed well with medication.  She will need to remain on this medication for the rest of her life, and have regular follow up visits with a cardiologist to monitor her progress.  Annie also takes a prescription Apoquel for seasonal allergies.",

            "description": "Luca is AN EXAMPLE OF AN IG in foster care in Los Angeles County.   He is a \"senior\" at between 13-14 years old. HE IS NOT UP FOR ADOPTION.\n\nWe don\u2019t know much about Luca\u2019s life before he came into Rescue but we do know he suffered many years of abuse and neglect.  Luca was found as a stray; his physical condition was very poor the result of living outside without shelter, food or basic care.   Of all the things we do not know about Luca we do know one, very important thing about him\u2026. his will to live.  Luca has overcome his physical challenges and is now healthy and thriving.  He appreciates every day and finds joy in being a \u201chouse-hound\u201d\u2026..  his favorite place in the house is his foster mom\u2019s bed.  He snuggles with her every night and loves to burrow in blankets.   According to Luca, a dog can \u201cnever have too many blankets\u201d.  It has been our job in Rescue to not only provide him with the medical support and care he needed to get healthy but to insure he never again is without a safe place to live and that he always has as many blankets as he wants.\n\nLuca\u2019s on-going medical care is minimal, he takes Hepato Support, an Rx supplement (milk thistle) that strengthens his liver; he is also on a soft , fresh food diet made by the Fresh Pet company.   We would like his permanent home to continue using both of these items.\n\nLuca is a little shy when meeting new humans but he is very comfortable with other dogs; having a dog companion in his new home would be helpful.  Luca does need assistance with learning some basic dog skills such as walking on leash.  He has shown a bit of fear and associates a leash with a negative experience.   He will go outside to potty if someone goes with him or if the door remains open so he knows he can come back inside and won\u2019t be left outside.     \n\nFor Luca to continue to evolve and thrive we feel that his new home should have someone who can be home with him to help guide and encourage him to overcome his uncertainesses and to help him feel safe in his new surroundings.  Someone who is experienced working with Rescue Dogs would be beneficial.  A dog friend in the family and having a bit of secure outdoor space to potty will help him make a successful transition from orphan to family member.\n\n\n",

He is energetic, loves to explore and go on walks or runs. He is affectionate and playful with people he trusts, weighs 40 to 45 pounds, and is all muscle! The ultimate companion once he chooses his humans, he loves to play fetch, have belly rubs and tolerates his baths very well! He is protective, and does love to patrol his area, so a securely fenced yard is a must for him. New people will need to let him come to you - approaching his human or his fence isn't a good idea unless he's certain the approaching person is a good human (he is a product of animal abuse and understandably leery of strangers). BJ enjoys getting all of the attention; and would need a meet and greet with any potential fur-siblings.\n\nHis adoption fee has been lovingly sponsored by one of our wonderfully supportive friends of animals. Please fill out an adoption application at our website - stoveranimalrescue.com - and make an appointment to come meet BJ!\n\n1/30/21 11:13 PM",

He is very sweet and loves toys and belly rubs. This guy is such a goofball and pretty sure there isn't anything he doesn't love, want to be friends with, or receive love from. Jethro is around 2-3 years old and is 60 pounds. Jethro is itching for a couch & a family to call his own\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES!

            "description": "Zorro is looking for his person and being one of the longest residents at the shelter, he can't wait to find his furever home! He is a 70 lb., four-year-old shepherd mix - we actually had him DNA tested and his results were quite interesting! Surprisingly, Zorro is 25% German Shepherd, 25% Catahoula Leopard, 25% American Staffordshire Terrier, 12.5% Boxer and 12.5% other. What a combo! \n\nThis handsome boy enjoys being active, spending time outside hiking or playing, and going on adventures. He loves to run around the yard but also enjoys cuddling on the couch. He already knows basic commands and is very smart! He takes treats gently and would be a highly motivated student for more training.  \n\nZorro will require an experienced adult-only home as an only pet. Adopters that will provide further enrichment, training, and exercise are a must. If you can open your heart and give this special dog the family he deserves, please email dogs@daws.org to set up an appointment to meet him.\n\nCheck Zorro out here: https://www.facebook.com/118446594853659/posts/2684473841584242?vh=e&d=n&sfns=mo\n\nKindly sponsored by William Nichols-Klaff (9/28)",

            "description": "Please note: Rocky is being fostered in the Twin City area so his adopter will need to be from this area as well. Several meet and greets will be required before adoption.\n\nRocky is a 4-year-old, 55-pound Golden Retriever who came to RAGOM when his loving family did not have the time to handle his behavioral needs.\n\nHe is a typical Golden who craves human contact and would do best with a family who is home most of the time and doesn't travel much. If you do travel, he'd love to come along--he enjoys car rides!\n\nDue to his resource-guarding tendencies, Rocky must be placed in an adult-only home with a physical fence and he cannot live with any other pets. His family must also be diligent about keeping human things out of his reach and allow him to play with his toys undisturbed.\n\nRocky is crate trained and walks well with a Gentle Leader. Continued training will be crucial for a successful adoption. He has learned so much in foster care and demonstrates great potential!\n\nFinally, Rocky requires a lot of exercise to burn off his high energy. If you're a runner, hiker, or cross-country skier, Rocky will fit nicely into your exercise routine.\n\nTo learn more about Rocky, see his bio at: https://ragom.org/dogs/rocky-18-007\n\nPlacement Requirements:\nGood With Dogs: No\nGood With Cats: No\nGood With Kids:  No \nFence: Physical fence required\nAge: 4\n\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs available at Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest (RAGOM), you can read our adoption process and apply to adopt, which can be found at https://ragom.org/our-adoption-process. RAGOM\u2019s adoption territory includes: Minnesota; Iowa; North Dakota; South Dakota; Western Wisconsin (within 75 miles of the Minnesota border)",

We think Lilly is a mixture of American Staffordshire terrier and French bulldog. She weighs about 30 lb.\n \nLilly needs an only-pet home with a fenced yard and some bigger kids to play with. She is very sweet and needs exercise. She would love to have obedience training and perhaps agility training or be a running partner.She will also need a refresher on house-training because she has been in boarding (no foster homes available).\n \nLilly is up-to-date on vaccines, heart worm negative and microchipped along with being spayed. She has a slight  under-performing thyroid and takes a supplement each day, but this is not an expensive medication.\n \nTo find out more about Lilly Bloom, call her buddy, Kelli, at 803-646-2593. She is currently in South Carolina. Lilly's adoption fee is $175. Transportation north is available at a very reasonable cost.",

            "description": "\nVance is a handsome boy and NEEDS A FOSTER HOME!!\nHouse trained\nVance is a Golden/Pyrenees mix and he is just a beautiful boy who desperately needs a foster home!!\nHe\u2019s not happy in the kennel and we can\u2019t blame him as it\u2019s kind of crazy at times with lots of barking going on \u2013 and we have a lot of dogs right now!\nHe will curl up on your lap and jump on your bed if you let him?. He loves \u2018his people\u2019, which right now is the kennel staff and volunteers.\n\nYou won\u2019t have to worry about squirrels or chipmunks in your yard as he\u2019ll chase them off for sure!\n\nHe definitely needs an experienced adult household, with no kids under 16, and an above ground fenced yard (no apartments). Vance is not a real social dog as he likes to be at home with his people and he likes his walks.\n\nCan anyone take this sweet boy out of the kennel?\n\nHe likes smaller dogs but he is not wild about larger dogs and no cats. This sweet boy likes walks around the park and walks fine on leash. While he was out and about at the kennel, he wanted lots of loving in the office!!! And\u2026 Vance Loves fetching toys!\nWe are still learning about this cutie, but if you would like to meet him and get him out of the kennel, please contact GRRAND ASAP!\nAt this time, we are unable to process any applications that are outside of the geographic areas listed below:\nGreater Louisville, KY (including adjacent southern Indiana)\nGreater Lexington, KY\nSouthern Indiana Counties:  Clark and Floyd\nOhio Counties: Hamilton, Butler, Warren, some areas within Clermont county, Montgomery and Green\nNorthern KY Counties: Boone, Kenton and Campbell\n \nTo inquire about a specific dog, we require that you first submit an adoption application.  Visit http://grrand.org/online-adoption-application/  to access our online application.  You do not need to fill out an application for each dog you are interested in learning more about.  Once your application is reviewed a GRRAND volunteer will contact you to begin the process.  Our Adoption Placement Coordinator will work with you to find a dog with the characteristics to best fit your family.",

He may be missing something, but from what is missing, he has gained in heart. Stanley came to us with a leg injury, one that was not new. The great staff at New York Veterinary Specialty Center tried for weeks to save his leg, but in the end, he felt relief having it amputated. Stanley seeks a home without other pets and with people to love him. Stanley has an affinity for people and he even was a perfect gentleman with his time spent with the girl scouts. Stanley is an energetic guy, but he is still figuring out the tripod life and he does get sore and need to build his stamina. Stanley needs a home!!!",

            "description": "\"Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free dog.\"\n\nAs a foster mom, I'd love to share with you a very special soul. Dobby's name is Dobby for a reason. He comes to rescue after a very abused past which led him to roam and hide for many months in southern MO. I'm not sure which is worse to imagine, his terror he once went through or the horribly embedded collar Dobby had prior to having it surgically removed. The images are too graphic to share but if you look into his eyes and see something there, we will expose how Dobby entered into rescue. For now, I want to share with you how much Dobby has grown in personality and all of his qualities.\n\nDobby has been in rescue since early February 2019. In little time, a fully feral dog, that shivered at the sight and touch of a human, he has come a long way. Dobby has learned, at least in his current setting, how to be a dog. A dog that shares space with other dogs (little to big, male and female); a dog that seeks affection and touch from humans (mainly women at this point); a dog that cuddles in bed every night or on the couch because he can; a dog that plays, rough-houses, and learns new things because it's fun and treats are wonderful; and a dog that found his voice, because what cattledog doesn't! Truth is, it wasn't just a patient, soft human that taught him these things - it was his fur-family as well. Dobby needs a patient and friendly fur-member to keep that spark in his eyes and share the confidence.\n\nDobby's ideal home setting would be patient, kind, positive, have a very secure, privacy fenced yard (likely not a chain link- it is too easy for him to be tempted to jump in a moment of scare), have another dog as sort of his guide, and for now, at least a human mom that will help ease him into a new home, setting and continue teaching him. Dobby is housebroken and crate trained and is very food motivated. Dobby takes treats gently from your hand and will continue gaining trust with people with some home exercises involving treats/food and hand feeding. He's also quite the talker! Loves to yoddle and approach for affection.\n\nDobby fears alpha dogs and would not do well paired with one. He likely isn't going to be an easy companion to take on a hike, as attaching a leash to his collar (even for a vet visit) is still very traumatic for him. In time, this can change but will take practice and positive encouragement. However, for the right family, Dobby could start his journey. He has met a lot of new people - from families coming over to visit and pick their newest member from a foster litter of puppies, to normal guests/neighbors and even the dog sitter. However, due to Dobby's unpredictable leash behavior, walks and outdoor events are not really his thing.\n\nIf you or your family see what loving soul he has to offer and up for a challenge, I know the loyalty and love he can share will bring mutual gain. Please submit an adoption application which helps us answer the most basic of questions to see if there's a potential connection between you and Dobby!",

            "description": "Roscoe\u2019s early years were not happy. When he came to Underdog, he was so fearful he couldn't even walk across the room without cringing, and he spent almost a month living in his exercise pen by the front door, coming out only for walks.  He didn't trust people and growled and snapped frequently.  He has gradually come out of his shell and as you can see by his pictures, is very loving and craves attention.  He still has a long way to go. He does not like to be picked up, and is easily startled by sudden movements or noises. He gets along well with the foster dogs he lives with, but reacts aggressively to any new dogs that come to visit. He is looking for a quiet home, no cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, etc., no small children.  He has always loved to go for walks, but must be on a secure leash as he will lunge at strange dogs and people.  He will need time to adjust to a new home, and will be fearfully aggressive during the transition, so must have someone who understands and is comfortable managing this behavior. He has a history of partial seizures and takes medication twice a day to keep them under control.  Adoption fee is $125.\n\n\nPS you can see videos of me on Underdog Rescue of Florida Facebook\n\nAll UnderDogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm checked, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick preventatives.  For consideration for one or more dogs, we require that an on-line application is filled out.  Go to www.UnderdogAdopt.com for our application.  Sorry, we do not adopt outside of Florida.  Applicants are subject to a home visit, and veterinary references will be checked. Please include a vet reference (including phone number) when applying online.\nOur application process:\nFIRST, an application must be approved for adoption from our rescue.\nSECOND, we determine whether the dog that has been applied for is a \"good match\" for the household that wants to adopt him/her.  We take into consideration the dog's activity level, compatibility with other members of the household (human and other pets), etc.\nIf your application has been approved, but the dog you applied for is no longer available, please take the time and look over our adoptable dogs again.  We will make every effort to find the right dog for an approved applicant.\nWe hope you agree and understand that our goal to find the best forever home is our #1 priority!",

            "description": "Jayne is a sweet 5-year-old girl. She is bouncy and energetic and would love an active home. Jayne loves going for walks in her harness and loves to run and play ball in our fenced pen. She is not an apartment dog and will need someone who will walk her on leash or who has a fenced yard. Jayne can be reactive when cornered and has run loose in the past, so for her safety, she should not be let off-leash. \n\nJayne would do best in an adult only home with no children and no cats. She enjoys wrestling and playing with other dogs, especially with her son Buddy (who is at the shelter and needs a home) and has some patented wrestling moves. While Jayne enjoys playing with other dogs it is important for her to have a proper introduction to any new dogs. Any dogs in the home will need to come meet Jayne before adoption to make sure the dogs are compatible. \n\nJayne can be nervous around new people, but if you go slow, she becomes super lovey-dovey, enjoys giving hugs, and loves having her belly rubbed. Jayne is generally more comfortable with women and would either like a home without men or a home where the men are gentle and patient, giving her lots of personal space and allowing her to come to them on her terms so she can learn to trust them with time.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this sweet girl, please start by filling out an adoption application that can be found on our website at trilakeshumanesociety.org or give us a call at 518-891-0017 if you would like a hard copy mailed to you. Once we have an approved adoption application we can set up an appointment for you to come in and meet Jayne, spend some time with her, and see if she is a good fit for you and your household.\n",

We think he is a mix between Border Collie and Whippet.\n\nHe requires an adult only home with a securely fenced, and large yard where he can get his zoomies out, or simply spend the afternoon lounging in the sun. He would not do well in an apartment or a condo. \n\nAndy is crate trained and has all of his obedience. He walks beautifully on a leash, knows how to run alongside of a bike and loves to explore nature and go hiking in the woods with his people. \n\nAndy requires daily exercise - even if that simply means throwing a toy in the yard. While he relaxes well inside, he can become anxious if he doesn\u2019t have a way to stretch his legs regularly. \n\nAndy has undergone extensive training, and he would do best with an owner willing to continue reinforcing what he knows. Follow up training is provided free of charge within the Sequim/Port Angeles areas.\n\nHe can get overexcited very easily, when doing things like meeting new people, or greeting those he really loves, so he\u2019d benefit from owners willing to help him practice calm, appropriate behavior. Andy would enjoy a canine companion that is balanced, calm and can be a mentor to him, as well as a play mate.\n\nAndy requires a special, high calorie diet, and daily supplements which will be provided. \n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com. Adoption donation $400.\n\nPlease contact Claudia at claudiaatwag@gmail.com for more information.",

She first came to FFL after being mistreated by her owner and taken in by a wonderful neighbor, and then went home with a loving foster. She had a history of isolation and neglect, but she is now on the path to recovery and is ready to find a forever home.\n\nBrownie is learning! Brownie is a smart dog who learns fast.  She knows to sit, down, stay, leave it, and off, and is working on shake. She is well behaved in the crate and kennel and is house-trained. Strong and sturdy, she sometimes tugs on her leash and could still use some work to master loose leash walking. \n\nBrownie loves to play!  Brownie has energy and loves to play and run around.  She would thrive in a house with a yard for her to run around in while supervised. She would do best in a home willing to provide her with healthy outlets for her mind and energy. A home without many visitors would also be ideal. \n\nBrownie needs patience!  Brownie is still trying to figure out what it means to be a well-loved pet.  She enjoys cuddles on her terms and is a very loving dog.  Prior to being taken in by her neighbor, she had never been shown affection and is still learning how to ask for snuggles. \n\nBrownie has all the potential in the world to be the best dog ever.  She is loyal, loving, and energetic.  She would do well in a home willing to be patient while working with her through training.  She is ready to heal from her rough past and live the rest of her life surrounded by love and happiness.  Apply to meet her today!\n",

She is the perfect companion and everything you could ask for in a doggy soulmate.  She is affectionate, smart, goofy, and - most importantly - waiting for her forever home! \n\nNala is well-rounded! She would make a great companion for any adventure you want to take her on. Nala loves car rides, either in her crate or safely secured in the back seat, and is happy to go on long drives with her family.  She loves to do whatever her humans are doing, whether than means going on a stroll, a hike, or relaxing on the couch.  She is easily excitable and has never been around cats or young children for that reason but she loves playing with dogs of a similar energy level.  She is wonderful at sharing toys and treats with other dogs and her humans but she\u2019s working on sharing her food.\n\nNala is a genius! She is super smart and eager to please her humans which means that she loves to learn new things.  So far, she is crate-trained, house-trained, and walks well on a leash.  She knows \u201cSit\u201d, \u201cLay Down\u201d, \u201cLoad Up\u201d, and is currently working on \u201cWait\u201d.  She is a high-energy pup and would do best in a home with a yard but could adapt to an apartment with the right amount of mental and physical stimulation. \n\nNala is the best cuddler in town!  She is super affectionate and wants to be a lapdog.  Her size is just right for her to snuggle up in your lap or by your side.  She enjoys sleeping in bed with her favorite people and likes to spend her days following her humans from room to room.  \n\nNala is an intelligent, silly, sweet dog with a personality that shines.  Her bubbly demeanor is contagious and her goofy antics and warm cuddles will put a smile on your face every day.  Nala is looking for a forever home that can work with her energy level and give her lots of love.  Apply to meet her today.\n",

            "description": "Dipper is as precious as they come, but can she can also be a lot to handle. That might be partly because she was thrown out of a car and tried to chase her people down. Since then, her biggest desire is to have someone of her own to love.\n\nDipper would do best with someone who has experience with a high energy dog and understands that she needs LOTS of exercise, stimulation and interaction, and who can laugh off the crazy antics of a high energy dog. She does best when she exercises before training and loves to play fetch. She really loves listening for direction and applying her smarts.\n\nThough she is high energy, she really is super sweet, and just wants nothing more than to be loved.\n\nDipper is dog selective. She gets along great with certain dogs but not all.\n\n\nAdoption Fees:\nKittens: $60, Cats (1 year plus): $50, Puppies: $250, Adult Canines (1 to 6 years): $200, Seniors (7 years plus): $100 (unless otherwise specified). Adoption fees are not a tax-deductible donation as allowed by IRS regulations. Adoption fees help to offset the cost of the pet's care incurred by Coastal Pet Rescue, which are generally 2 to 3 times the adoption fee amount.\nSome special circumstances may change the fee; see pet's listing for actual adoption fee.\n\nAll Coastal Pet Rescue pets are current on shots, microchipped* and spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters are responsible for any shots that may be due after adoption (particularly for kittens and puppies that must have three rounds of shots to be protected).\n\nMicrochip:\nCPR has implanted a microchip as part of the adoption process and the chip is included in the adoption fee. However, some chip companies require a registration fee varying from $9.99 to $19.99. The registration fees are the responsibility of the adopter and are NOT included in the CPR adoption fee. Adopters may add this cost to their adoption fee to have CPR register the chip on their behalf.\n\n30 Days Pet Insurance: \nAs a Petfinder member, all adopters are entitled to a free 30 day insurance policy through PetFirst. Coastal Pet Rescue is not responsible for this policy. Adopters must call PetFirst\u2019s toll-free number 855-710-7387 to activate the coverage. If adopters fail to call, the policy will not be activated.",

She arrived as a stray. \n\nApproximate Age / Weight: 3 Years Old and 45 lbs.\n\nPersonality:   Tater Tot has come a long way since she's been in foster care.  She can be unsure when meeting new people, particularly men.  We\u2019ve watched her blossom and make strides in her confidence in foster care, but we are still working on her confidence around men.  At this time, Tater requires a quiet home with no adult males and not many visitors.\n\nThis energetic girl would love a doggie playmate.  She has a blast at dog daycare, so a home with another energetic dog is a bonus!   Tater loves to play chase and romp with her dog friends during the day and will happily cozy up with a chew bone when everyone settles down at night. She's a super affectionate and cuddly girl with her people and those she knows.   She\u2019s also a graduated training class with flying colors! \n\nForever Home:  Tater would love to be part of an active family and, ideally, have an energetic canine pal.  Though Tater is much better meeting new women, she still struggles when meeting new men.   So, for her comfort, we are seeking a home without men.    Our sweet girl would also do best in a quieter home without a lot of house guests or young children.   No invisible fences for Tater, please. \n\n<p align=\"\"justify\"\"><B>Contact:</B> Please contact wtdr2008@yahoo.com to adopt Tater!\n\n <p align=\"\"justify\"\">\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Pre-Adoption Application:</strong></p>  To be considered for a dog, it is best to submit a pre-adoption application.  The pre-adoption application can be downloaded from our website - www.waggintailsdogrescue.org/adoptionprocess.html.  Just complete the application and email it back to wtdr2008@yahoo.com<p align=\"\"justify\"\">\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Waggin' Tails Adoption Information:</strong></p>  Waggin' Tails Dog Rescue has a standard adoption fee of $225 for adult dogs.  Different adoption fees apply for older dogs, small breeds and puppies - $125 for senior dogs (9 years +) , $275 for small breed dogs and $250 for puppies, plus a $50 deposit which is returned upon proof of spay/neuter.  Our adoption process includes an application, vet reference checks, and a home visit.<p align=\"\"justify\"\">Waggin' Tails Dog Rescue does not have a shelter facility.  All of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  To meet a dog in person, please see our event calendar on our website at www.waggintailsdogrescue.org for the latest information.  Arrangements can be made to meet our rescue dogs outside of Saturday adoption events after an approved application is submitted.  This application does not imply an obligation to adopt by the applicant or by the rescue group.<p align=\"\"justify\"\">  Our volunteers have made rescue a second job that they do in their spare time after coming home from full-time jobs.  E-mail inquiries are the quickest way to obtain information about a dog. <p align=\"\"justify\"\">Thank you for your support of rescue and your interest in a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Cooper is a handsome hound about 3 years old. He is very tall with long legs. He seems to be good with other dogs. He is not good with cats. He was surrendered because he was too rough with kids. He has a very loud, musical bay. He is microchipped.  He is not house trained yet.  He can be food aggressive and posessive with his toys.   \nCooper is looking for a forever family to call his own. His adoption fee is $200, which includes neuter surgery and vaccinations (parvo/distemper and rabies.) If you would like to meet this dog, please email us: scfourpaws@hotmail.com or leave a message @ 435/752-3534. Please be patient with us getting back to you as we are all volunteers with full-time jobs. Thanks for your interest in this wonderful dog!!",

Look into her soul! & we promise you Ramona that somewhere out there is someone who wants to love you the way you deserve\nMeet baby girl Ramona! She had a very rough start in life after being dumped in the Redlands with her sister Renegade & mom Rosy Posy to fend for themselves. We saved all three & happy to say both mom & sister have wonderful homes but its now time for our Ramona. She would do well in a home with women or a male who is very experienced with dogs & definitely ANOTHER DOG would be great as she loves other doggies. She takes a lot of time to warm up to you but once she does as many of our volunteers will vouch she is super sweet, completely housebroken, very quiet, and calm when she's with you but has lots of puppy energy when out on a walk. Stock up on squeaky toys as she loves them Oh! and treats too.When Ramona lets you in to her heart and earns your trust she'll be the most loyal and loving girl. She's truly what rescue is about & needs love & an understanding owner - could that be you?Save time and get pre-approved by filling out an adoption application online left side forms/apps justinbartlettanimalrescue.org this does not commit you to her adoption and only pre-approves you to adopt any of our pups",

He is super sweet and even allows Jade to eat with him from the same bowl.\n\nDusty's Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vIndividualCurrentDog.aspx?dogid=69713\nAdoptable Dog Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vCurrentDogs.aspx\n\nIf you'd like to adopt one of our beagles:\n*Go to our Website - href=\"http://beaglemaryland.org\n*Review our  Standards for Adoption - http://beaglemaryland.org/Home.aspx?pg=standardsforadoption.htm\n*Fill out an Adopter Profile - http://beaglemaryland.org/new_site/documents/adopterprofilenew.htm\n and email it to us (or print it off, fill it in and send it via regular mail, if you prefer)\n*A BRSM volunteer will contact you to guide you through the rest of the process!\n\nWe hope to hear from you, and so do the beagles!",

Duke likes most other dogs, and when he likes a dog, he LOVES to play,  running and wrestling and is very tolerant.  \nDuke had some resource guarding of people in his first home, where he decided the Mom of the house was \"his\" and he didn't like anyone else approaching her inside or outside the home.  Because of this, we are looking for a more experienced dog owner, with no small children.  He has also reacted badly when overstimulated so we are working on training to help with that.  He really is such a sweet, cute boy and we know with the right home and right, consistent training he will be the best boy! If you're interested, please fill out an application and our behavior manager will get with you to share more info for this special boy.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our adoptable dogs, please fill out an application at https://www.mlar.org/adoption-overview\n\nE-mails regarding adoption are not considered an application. \n\nOut-of-state applicants (outside PA/NJ/DE) will not be considered, unless there are special circumstances. \n\nPlease visit our web site for more detailed information on the animals in our care, our educational campaigns, and for helpful tips on adoption.  www.MLAR.org",

He is a larger chubby  Frenchie at around 42 lbs. Marcel is an extremely affectionate dog. He loves to play with toys. He loves to snuggle in blankets and wrap himself up like a burrito. He loves FOOD! He is super smart! He is great with other dogs as long as he is the boss dog, He walks well on the leash and likes rides in the car. He is a furniture dog! \n\nThe Bad\n\nMarcel does not do well with cats and should be in a cat free home. He can jump almost any babygate! As is often typical with bulldogs, Marcel may be prone to skin issues so a quality diet and regular flea prevention is a must. \n\nThe Ugly\n\nWe do not know what happened in Marcel\u2019s past, but it did kind of mess him up. Marcel is severely cage aggressive. He is not to be crated and if boarding is needed, a very savvy kennel will be required. \n\nMarcel also has some major boundary issues and when pushed is quite reactive. If pushed, he will likely bite. When he first came to foster care, he was terrified of going outside we suspect fearful of not being let back in and trying to make him go outside was not and option as he would react. At first we could trick him into going out about once a day. Since then he now goes out with the other dogs and will occasionally even ask to go but still he does not like to go out at night. Because of this we consider him about 74% housetrained and may still have an accident. While getting him to go outside has been where we have seen this most, he does react to other things as well. \n\nAs, we said you absolutely cannot make Marcel do anything but if you can make him think it is his idea \u2013 all is good. \n\nThe Rest\n\nMarcel seeks an adult only, cat free indoor home with a securely fenced back yard. A dog door may address some of his issues though he may also refuse to even consider one. Previous experience with dogs with behavioral issues is a must. Marcel is safe and relatively well adjusted in his foster home but we would love to see if there is a more perfect fit for him and since we do not want to set him up to fail we will not settle for less than perfect! \n\nMarcel is neutered, current on vaccines, heartworm negative and on prevention and chipped. \n\nLOCAL INQUIRIES ONLY",

            "description": "Hey, it\u2019s me again. I am still looking for my forever home. I have been in my foster home now for a while and I\u2019m even better now than when I first came here. I am 9 years old and completely blind. Don\u2019t let that scare you. I am just like any other dog. I like to play and follow you around and I love attention, just like any other dog. Being blind doesn\u2019t slow me down. There are a few things to think about when you care for a blind dog but really life with me is pretty easy. I am potty trained and can be left by myself when you leave. However, I do much better with another dog in the house when I am left alone. So, I am looking for a home with another dog and if not another dog than a parent  that is home most of the time. I do well on car rides. I will love to follow you around and sitting in your lap. I am a real lover boy. Because I am blind I would not be good for an elderly person as I can be a trip hazard. Also I can\u2019t go in a home with a swimming pool or small children. My foster parents think I am the greatest foster EVER!  Please come by and see me in person.\nAll DFW Tzus dogs are spayed/neutered, UTD on vaccines, heart worm tested and on heart worm preventative and microchipped.\n<font color=\"purple\">Please go to our website:     www.dfwtzusandmorerescue.com   \nfor complete instructions on our adoption process and for adoption application. </font>\nCheck our website for directions/times of our next Tzu Review/Adoption event at a local Petsmart.\n<font color=\"purple\">Note: The children of adopters must be age 6 or older.</font>\n\n<bold> WE ADOPT IN THE DFW METROPLEX AREA ONLY. </bold>\n\n<font color=\"fuchsia\"><bold> <h2>WE ARE ALWAYS IN NEED OF VOLUNTEERS/FOSTER HOMES.</h2><br></bold> \n<bold>PLEASE GO TO OUR WEBSITE TO COMPLETE A VOLUNTEER/FOSTER APPLICATION\n OR TO MAKE A DONATION TO ASSIST WITH THE MEDICAL CARE OF OUR RESCUED DOGS.

And then I found myself homeless. How much can a girl take? I have had a troubled past for sure. But then one day recently, my prayers were answered. I was rescued from that loud and noisy shelter by Angels!\n\nAnd get this ...! They actually took me to a \"dogtor,\" a real dog-tor! Now, I am ready to dance! All I need is a partner! So, if you are interested in a cute, mature stunning lady to bring into your life, I'm your girl!\n\nI would do better in a home as an only dog, but I promise to love you all the more. I am crate and house trained. I love car rides. I do pull on the leash so you need to be strong to walk me..\nAnd\nI am spayed and ready to rumba!\n\nI would love to be that special someone to somebody, and watch TV next to them from the sofa, and snuggle up to them at night. So if you think I am the girl for you, please contact the Angels! Tell them Emmey sent you! I am ready to go to my fur-ever home.\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

Due to the volume of interest in our animals and the convenience we now offer of applying online for adoption, we are no longer able to reply to messages sent through our Petfinder page. Messages received through Petfinder will go unanswered.\nCopy and paste this URL link to learn everything you need to know about the adoption process and to fill out the application.\nhttps://www.grandstrandhumanesociety.com/adopt/\n\nGage has been in a foster home for quite some time and while he has generated a lot of interest the right forever home has not been found for him yet. \n\nHe would not do well in home with cats or children. As you can see from his photos he has a soft side and is a goof ball. He loves other dogs but is dog selective. He will be the alpha dog.  His story is a long sad one. He was trained horribly, the old chain em up and tease and tortured until he bit. Then he was brought to us and dropped off. Shortly after, hurricane Florence was hitting SC and the shelter was evacuated.  Once we returned to the shelter, we noticed that he had chewed his back foot nearly to the bone likely due to the stress of evacuation. He was taken in by an experienced foster to be treated and go through rehab. It took 9 months to heal. \nHe will need an owner who understands the breed and who can be firm with him. He is a rescue, they are not flawless. \nBecause he\u2019s in a foster home a meet and greet will be scheduled once it\u2019s determined that an adopter is possibly a good fit for Gage. If you think you are the right person to give this beautiful boy a home and would like to speak to Gage\u2019s foster family to learn more about him please contact our Enrichment Counselor, James. He can be reached on his cell number 410-533-8676.",

            "description": "Sahara is a beautiful 4-1/2 year old spayed female who was previously a Pittie Paw Rescue Dog and has had a rough past.  Guardians for the Animals of Ohio Rescue pulled her from Knox Animal Shelter after she was seized from the former Rescue.   \n\nHer foster has this to say about this amazing girl: \n\nI know of multiple homes she was in and they didn\u2019t give her a chance, didn\u2019t work with her and didn\u2019t devote enough time to her. She\u2019s had urine burns at one point, dog fights at another, close to being euthanized at the shelter and she\u2019s just been all around let down. She is one of the best girls ever, for most people. She does occasionally leash bite but with a constant reminder and harnesses, she has the potential to do really well. She is fairly calm on her own, she doesn\u2019t approve of being in a crate but can be left out unattended if needed. We prefer to house her in a heavy duty crate.\n\n \n\nShe does have potential to be with another dog with very slow, steady intros but due to multiple attack\u2019s in the past.. she\u2019s slow to trust other dogs. She is really good with cats and absolutely adores children. She can go for walks without reacting to other dogs but enjoys her person overall. She is house trained and a complete cuddle expert.....she will never let you down with company for a night in. She\u2019s been let down so many times in the past and it shocks me how when she\u2019s truly a good girl. She knows multiple commands and is eager to learn more. She\u2019s very treat motivated as well.\n\n \n\nShe is really just looking for her forever place to crash, with someone who won\u2019t give up on her.  If interested in more information please contact Guardians for the Animals of Ohio Rescue or fill out an adoption application to meet Sahara.",

I get along with other dogs once properly introduced and I LOVE to play chase and wrestle with my foster siblings.  I am house trained on a schedule and I am not a chewer nor destructive at all. I am an all around friendly, loving, cuddly guy and would be a great companion who wants nothing more than to hang out with you. \n\nIf you would like to meet me please go to www.newbestfriend.org and submit an adoption application.

She is a very smart girl who knows basic commands and enjoys being the best dog she can be!  Her house manners are impeccable and she rarely barks. Not a fan of other animals, Miss Brownie wants to be your one and only and would prefer a quieter neighborhood where she won't see dogs on every corner.  If you have a fence and/or love to hike in more rural areas she\u2019s perfect!  Here's what Brownie's foster mom says about her ... \n\n\"Brownie is a loving, affectionate, obedient girl who LOVES carrying around her blanket. She enjoys car rides, being out in the sunshine, and playing with her toys. She takes treats gently from your hand, knows basic commands, and walks well on a leash. She rarely barks, but often makes a cute snorting sound that always brings a smile to our faces! Brownie is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped. She was heartworm positive, but the shelter advocates raised the funds needed to treat her. She has completed her HW treatment and is ready now to find her loving, forever home! Brownie has received professional training  thru US Canine in Buford and comes with a lifetime of ongoing training with them if necessary.\" \n\nFor more information about Brownie, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org.

I am a handsome, 1 year old, 45lb., Boxer mix. I am a shy guy and will need a family that is okay with me just observing them. I will need a family with a lot of patience and willingness to give me time to warm up. I am looking for a home with another dog to help me come out of my shell. I will need a privacy fenced in backyard to stretch my long legs in. I love to play and run! Kids can be a little too loud for me so I need a home without them. I am also not a fan of those cat creatures. I am not a fan of the crate but will be fine in a doggie play pen. I am potty trained and can be vocal when I need to go potty. Due to this and the fence thing, apartment life is not for a guy like myself! I cannot wait to meet you and start on our forever! What do you say? Can you see me in your forever? \n\nMy  fee is $150 and includes 3 rounds of dewormer, 2 parvo/distemper vaccinations, Bordetella vaccination, spay/neuter, 2 wellness exams, and microchip! *adopters are responsible for final round of parvo/distemper vaccination and rabies vaccine if adopted before 12 weeks of age* If you are interested in adopting me/meeting me, please fill out an application at www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/",

Below the map is our logo and the link to click on to access adoption forms, contact info or to donate. ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\n\n\nAdoption Fee:  $100.00\n\n \nRoccoboy is a precious little fella who is 11 years old and weighs about 8 pounds.  His family was no longer able to care for him, so he came to SCMR.\n\nHe is a wonderfully sweet boy; however, he has a collapsing trachea that we are monitoring and luxating patellas' in both knees. He is not a candidate for surgery as his kneecaps are now frozen inward causing him to walk bowlegged.  He has lost all but 4 of his teeth but does well eating wet food and kibble that has been softened. \n\nHe also has environmental allergies.  We have learned that he is highly allergic to Febreze, so any home adopting him will have to agree to not use that product in the home.  Febreze comes in candles, spray bottles, wall plug ins, Gain laundry detergent, liquid laundry softer, and it is also in kitchen garbage bags.  Febreze causes him to break out with skin sores and scratches constantly when he has been exposed. \n\nRoccoboy also has an extremely enlarged heart  The veterinarian can only hear a slight murmur, but the x-rays show his heart is very large.\n\nHe is partially house trained, being able to use peepads most of the time, but he is not willing to venture outside for any reason, preferring to stay inside.  He is not one to want to snuggle and sit with his humans, preferring to use his doggie bed to nap for a lot of the day.\n\nRoccoboy should be the only dog in the home.  He may get along with larger pets but does seem to have issues with and will fight smaller dogs.  There are no cats in the home so it is unknown how he would be with them. \n\nThis cutie is relaxing in Gainesville, FL until he is adopted.  He is loved and being well cared for in his foster home, being included as part of the family.\n\n\nNOTE: SCMR DOES NOT adopt to homes with children under the age of 10 years or homes with Electric Fences\n\nOut-of-state adoptions are possible; however, the approved adoptive home is responsible for making the necessary arrangements to pick up their new little one.",

Or, just hypothetically, if you have an ear out of place while a picture is being taken. I'm Zoe and I need a friend like that! \n\nI'm a 7-year-old mixed breed girl and have been learning all kinds of great things lately. I love my toys and I'm a great athlete. I have also been rocking the basic obedience classes, which will help me be a perfectly poised pooch when I go home with you! I'm super selective about my four-legged dog friends and appreciate a slow introduction, but being an only dog in my new home would be best. \n\nPart of my training is learning to trust people, which is awesome because they use treats to get to know me better. And, to be honest, I am pretty happy getting treats and might be working this angle just a bit!\n\nI also have a unique skill -- I can hold not just one, not just two, not even just three, but FOUR tennis balls in my mouth! Go me! \n\nDo you think you might be my person, the friend person who will adjust my ear before I have a photo taken? The one who will love me and appreciate my remarkable self? The one who will give me time to trust and feed me treats? \n\nIf you think we might be good together, please text or call The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387 for more information about me. \n\n*Zoe is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and ready for her home. She's staying in the Kansas City metro area, but transport is available to the right home. She's eligible for a no-cost adoption with an encouraged donation. \n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS PET? Fill out an Adoption Application now! Appointments can also be made to meet a pet by calling us at 913-671-PETS (913-671-7387).  \n\nADOPTION INFORMATION:\nPrior to adoption, our animals are: \n**Tested for diseases \n**Vaccinated \n**Spayed/neutered \n**Microchipped \n\nNO COST adoptions with an encouraged donation are accepted. \n\nThe Pet Connection also offers adopters a FREE veterinary examination and a medical care support plan for 60 days after adoption, as well as lifetime behavioral training, safe sanctuary for pets returned in emergency situations, extensive assistance with lost and found pets, and other expert pet services in a variety of areas, including pet selection, behavioral issues, general training, nutrition, and transition to adoptive homes.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.thepetconnection.org for more information about The Pet Connection and for a full listing of our available pets, \n\nCall or text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387 if you can foster, adopt, or sponsor a special needs dog or cat! \n\nThe Pet Connection is a membership organization operating a no-kill adoption center located at 417 N Rawhide Suite H, Olathe, KS 66061.\n\n",

In addition to being deaf, it was found that she had 2 serious heart conditions and we initially did not think she would survive. However over time she continued to grow and act like any other dog. We brought her to a cardiologist where it was found that the two heart conditions are actually what is keeping her alive. One counter acts the other. \n\nTallulah is part of our Forever Foster Program for dogs that are not likely to be adopted.  We find wonderful foster homes willing to foster for the life of the dog while we provide financial support for medical/veterinary needs.  These are wonderful dogs who through no fault of there own are unable to find permanent homes in a timely manner; usually due to age, medical and/or special needs.\n\nTwice a year she sees the cardiologist for a check up and evaluation of her prescription medicines.  Talullah is being permanently fostered by one of our 2 time adopters, who has deaf dalmatian experience.  \n\n\nTo sponsor/donate via PayPal use our email address rescue@savethedals.org\n\nIf you prefer to mail us your donation please email us at info@savethedals.org.\n\nThank you\n\n",

When I was just a puppy, I peed in the house and my human Dad picked me up by my neck, opened the door, and threw me as far as he could. Right then and there, I've never felt safe in this world.\n     Then, my human Mom moved out and took us, but with nowhere to go, we were all living in a truck so she gave me to a nice rescue where they love me and promise to never let anyone hurt me again. It takes me a while to warm up to women, (I probably won't ever trust men AT ALL) but once I trust you I LOVE to just be in your lap as much as possible. I get along with other small dogs, but prefer not to share my new Mom with but maybe just 1 or 2 dogs at most, cats are ok too. I REQUIRE a 6 ft fence with absolutely no spaces for me to escape (if I were to get out you'd most likely never catch me) If you want to find out more about me, CALL (757) 432-9222.",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks. Pretty 85 lb tri-color girl wants a home of her own\n\nKia is a young adult female, about 85 lbs so not too big and not too small. Very friendly to people she trusts and a good girl on a leash. She likes to play ball Akita style meaning she will get the ball once and then it belongs to her!\n\nShe is learning basic commands and can sit like a pro, especially if a tasty treat is involved!! She is not reactive to other polite dogs while on leash but she will tell rude dogs to back off!! Kia is a sassy akita girl that knows her worth!! She does not want other animals invading her space, therefore accordingly, she would do best as the only pet in the home. She has never lived with children and because their behavior can be unpredictable, she would do better in a home with teens and up who will be respectful of her boundaries. Kia is more aloof and independent versus velcro and constantly needing attention. But this girl can lay the cuteness on thick when she knows you are her people!!! COME MEET KIA TODAY!!!\n\n#AkitaRanch 28930 Ellis Ave Romoland CA Open 10-5 daily.

Or maybe you could just throw that stick over there? I'm getting pretty good at bringing it back. I'm Moonie and I like to keep things simple. I enjoy scratches, finding all the balls in the neighborhood, staring at squirrels in trees... I'm very interested in outdoor cats, but mostly just stare at them. I like car rides, snuggles on the couch (WHY won't my foster family let me be on the couch?! Sigh). I used to live with other dogs and did fine, except I didn't like sharing food. So if I could eat separately from other dogs, that would help me feel safe. Sometimes I'm really interested in what's going on during a walk and I need reminding of where I'm supposed to go, but I'll come if you remind me.\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "Good with dogs: Yes\nGood with cats: No\nGood with kids: No\nCrate trained: Yes\nHouse trained: Mostly\n\nHeavens Tabetsy (who goes by Tabby) is one of the sweetest and most affectionate dogs you will ever meet. She is also one of the shyest, as she gets very scared around new people and places. Tabbys first instinct is to run away from what she is scared of, but if that is not an option, she will freeze and occasionally go to the bathroom out of fear. However, once she is comfortable with you, Tabby acts like a normal playful puppy and will shower you with kisses and cuddles!\n\nTabby takes a few hours to warm up to a new person and about a week to become fully comfortable. She gets very attached to her people and tries to stay as close as possible around the house. She loves attention and will remind you with some hilariously uncoordinated pawing! Tabby is very playful and absolutely loves other pups! She is most comfortable around other dogs, and she will need a home with at least one confident pup to help show her the ropes. When she is not playing, Tabby is very calm inside and will relax next to her person or in her crate. The crate is her safe space and she is always happy to spend time there. Tabby is fully leash trained and is looking for an adopter who will continue to expose her to new situations. She might never warm up immediately to new people, but she is already making great progress learning that the world is not so scary! Tabby is a special girl, and if you give her time to warm up, the affection and gratitude she gives in return will make you fall madly in love.\n\nAge: 3 years\nWeight: 50 lbs.\n\nPlease Note: All dogs are posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at www.lasthopek9.org.\n\nQuestions? Please email adoptions@lasthopek9.org. For more photos, or information on upcoming adoption events where you can meet her, please go to www.lasthopek9.org or go to our Facebook page. Thank you for your interest in saving a life!",

I love to go out to the park and explore the fields and (my all time favorite), play in the water! I truly believe I was born to swim...I would swim all day if I was allowed to! I love to dive under to get rocks from the bottom of the creeks, and I love playing a good ole' game of fetch, too! I will retrieve anything you throw into the water! I am looking for a home with no kids or cats, however, I do get along with other dogs and enjoy their company! I would love a family who is very outdoorsy and adventurous just like me, and who has strong dog handling experience. I am a smart boy and I can't wait to show you everything that I know!\n\nRomeo's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip and current vaccinations plus a 6 week basic obedience course at Cedar Run in Hiawatha, IA. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, altered and kept current on vaccinations and preventatives. Our adoption process includes reference and vet checks, a background check and a home visit. Please complete an adoption application for consideration at AdoptHope.org",

He was flown to us by the local SPCA because great homes are in short supply on the island.\nBolt spent the first seven months of his life on a chain in the yard 24/7. Bored with no company and nothing to do, he resorted to digging and the landlord said he had to go.\nBolt is used to other dogs, and used to being around children. We're not sure about cats. He is a very energetic little guy, but he's also wicked smart. He graduated from our Beginners Group training class, and he LOVES to learn and work! He learns fast, and it lights him up with happiness.\nBolt is happy 24/7, and you can't look at him and not break out into a smile. He's a comedian and he loves to make people smile. He's super cute, both in looks and personality.\nBolt will need some patience, training and time to get used to the world around him. All he knew was a chain for most of his puppyhood, and our Ranch is a pretty quiet place.\n\nTo meet Bolt, please complete our online application for adoption: www.deafdogrescueofamerica.org/adoption-application.html\n\nPlease note that we are unable to respond to inquiries, emails or phone calls. Our adoption process starts with completion/submission of an application for adoption. All applications are reviewed as quickly as we can, and our adoption process is not first come, first served. We select our adoptive homes according to what our dogs/puppies require. If you are selected as an appropriate match, you will be contacted to set an appointment to visit the Ranch and meet Bolt.",

Do not let his age fool you... with the mention of the word, \"ball\", he immediately turns into a puppy again! The key to being his best friend is throwing his tennis balls. It must be seen to be understood. Rue is house-trained and can follow basic commands such as sit, stay, down. If he hears the word ball, his ears perk up and he will fly to bring you one. Once comfortable in his surroundings, he will snuggle up and let you love him. He is great with children, cats, but should be the only dog in the home. He does require a meet and greet. Rue is part terrier...so he is vocal & fast. This love bug needs a family who will be present and play with him. Applications are available on our website www.onedogatatime.us",

            "description": "Ricco is about  2  yrs old and weighs 52 lbs.   Ricco is about  2  yrs old and weighs 52 lbs.  Ricco aka Lucky is an energetic dog that needs to play, walk and run. He is curious and puppy-like and is happy-go-lucky, playful, and a little bit of a klutz. He likes to be around people and his tail is always wagging. He is friendly with family members, visitors, and kids (we have a six -year old).\n\nRicco aka Lucky needs basic house training and to learn commands. We have been working on potty training, but he is not yet house-broken. He has already learned to \u201csit\u201d for meal service, and now willingly goes into his kennel when told \u201ckennel\u201d. He has been working on \u201ccome\u201d and \u201cstay\u201d, but not quite there yet. He is motivated by treats. Lucky needs a patient family who can teach him all he needs to know about \u201chouse rules\u201d. Lucky does well on a leash and does very well on walks. He is a great jumper, so if you keep any ball-shaped fruit on the counter, he will retrieve it and play ball; until he learns that counters are off-limits! (real-life situation!)\n\nLucky appears to be a great family dog due to his playful nature and would be a good guard dog due to his loyalty and human resource-guarding instinct.\n\nLucky is curious about other pets. We have a tortoise and a cat. He will bark at the cat and sniff the tortoise.  I believe Lucky would do well as an only pet. He will defend himself quite vigorously if threatened or attacked by another dog and will not easily give up.  More will be known about me soon.   \n\nA Path 4 Paws holds adoption events EVERY Saturday & Sunday from 10am-4pm at C-A-L Ranch,  located at 232 N. Jones Blvd right off the I-95.   Please bring your dog(s) for a meet and greet (if applicable)\n\nIf you are interested in Ricco, please contact dogrescuelv@hotmail.com to confirm the dog you are interested in,  will be attending that particular weekend.  We have limited space at the store, therefore we can not take every dog out to the event.\n\nRicco is spayed/neutered, has current vaccinations and includes a microchip, deworming and 2 free vet visits.  Adoption fee applies.  Please make sure you have read the information listed on the homepage for requirements and restrictions. \n\nFoster homes & volunteers are always needed.  Please contact us regarding how you can help by fostering or volunteering for our organization.",

            "description": "Duke is a beautiful brindle babe who has been searching for his forever family since3/19/2019.\n\nDuke came to the shelter as an owner surrender due to no fault of his own. Duke was not being treated fairly by a small child in the home which left him broken and down. Since being at the shelter, Duke has shown that he can be a very sweet and loving boy once he gets to know you. With his past, Duke can be shy at first when meeting new people. Treat motivated, Duke loves to please and show off his obedience. Duke enjoys participating in play groups at the shelter as well as going on lunch runs to McDonalds.\n\nDuke's forever family would consist of no small children, cats or other animals. This home will also include no children coming to visit the home due to his negative past experiences. As far as doggy siblings, Duke would prefer a more submissive playmate who will allow him to be the head honcho. Dog siblings will also be dependent on a meet and greet with an approved adopter. His forever family would ideally be home more than away and social butterflies need not apply! Duke's family will also need a fenced in yard to allow him to run and play as he pleases. \n\nPotential adopters will need to understand that they will partake in multiple meet and greets with Duke to allow him to become more comfortable and trusting. Staff recommends waiting at least 2 months at minimum until trying introductions with other adults, which would need to occur outside of the home. A breed experienced owner, with knowledge of slow intros and an understanding that Duke may never be a social butterfly will be preferred. \n\n If interested in adopting Duke, please visit www.lebanonhumane.org for all the details on our current adoption process and application. Completed applications can be sent to info@lebanonhumane.org",

            "description": "Adoption Fee: $250\nFostered in Indian Trail, North Carolina\nAge: 8 years\nWeight: 7 lbs.\n\n8/5/20 - Bubbles is doing really well right now.  Her prognosis after her relapse was very guarded because usually pups do not fair well when a relapse occurs.  She is pretty much back to her normal self, bossy and going at the others if they do something she does not approve of.  Bubbles will always need to be under the care of a specialist.  She is currently on prednisone every other day and a chemo drug every other day, which will likely be for the protocol for the rest of her time.  She sees the specialist when she is not feeling well and then every couple months bloodwork and to make sure everything is still ok.  The chemo drug can cause other problems, hence the reason for continued care with her specialist.\n\n10/24/19 -  Bubbles is having some GI issues again.  She has been throwing up for a week or two and none of the anti-nausea meds have been helping.  She had an ultrasound today and her pancreas looked inflamed and portions of her intestines looked inflamed as well.  Her bloodwork was also indicative of GI issues.  Her belly also filled with fluid yesterday and has not gone down.  The liquid is clear and likely her body storing water.  We are starting her on a round of steroids and antibiotics and will wait for the review of the ultrasound by a radiologist And some additional bloodwork and urine check.  She may need an endoscopy or biopsy to get a better idea of what is going on, but we need to wait for the inflammation to go down and her to feel better before doing so.  \n\n4/15/19 \u2013 Bubbles is still the same little girl!  She has been doing great on her prescription food and has not had any issues.  She does still have moments where she loses her self confidence and will bite, we say she is like Jekyll and Hyde.  She will also go after the other dogs if she does not want them around or is protecting a bone or toy or spot on the couch.  She can also be very loving and happy and wanting all the attention she can get.  She just has her moments sometimes. \n\n 7/5/16 ? Bubbles is still feisty as ever. She loves to play with her foster brothers, she just isn?t so sure about humans sometimes. She can be so happy and friendly with people and want attention and then all of the sudden becomes insecure and scared and snaps. Being on her prescription food and Pepcid has taken care of all her tummy issues and she seems a bit happier now too. She is prone to bite more when she is not feeling well, which is understandable since people get cranky when they do not feel good too. She needs a home that can understand her fears and handle them and it would be great if there was another dog about her size and age to play with too.\n\n\n5/4/15 - Bubbles recently had some medical issues and spent a good bit of time at the vet, but after several tests it was found that she has irritable bowel disorder. She is on Prednisone, Pepcid, Anti-Nausea medicine and a prescription diet. Thankfully this has solved her throwing up and diarrhea and she is back to her happy loving self. Although she can be happy and loving and very playful, she does have the other side of her where she has bitten. When she loses her self confidence and becomes unsure of the situation she has bitten and has drawn blood. Her foster parents have learned to read her behaviors to know when this may happen and have worked around it. She does better one on one with people instead of having multiple people giving her attention. She does love belly rubs, playing with people and other pups, and exploring the back yard. She absolutely loves her prescription diet and tells you when you are not getting it done fast enough for her. Bubbles would do best in a home with young pups, no children, and people who understand her personality quarks and can let her grow and learn in a safe environment and do not mind the occasional snap when she becomes unsure of the situation or unsure of herself.\n\n\n5/22/2014 - Bubbles loves chilling in a nice comfy bed or on the couch, running around the yard with the other pups yelling at the neighbor dogs, and on occasion plays with other pups in her foster home. She is an excellent eater and likes to chew on bones. She is a very loving and happy little girl. At times she gets a bit of an attitude and wants to only do what she wants to do and does not hesitate to let you know.\n\n12/24/2013 - My story is the story of  \"The Princess to The Pauper\"!\n\nIn my previous life, I was the only furchild of a single, elderly lady who loved me unconditionally. We did everything together, went to the post office, watched tv, ate dinner and slept in the bed! When my Mom passed away, I was given to her daughter and grandson to live. This is where things got a little tricky.\n\nI had become so accustomed to my simple-spoiled life that I had a hard time adjusting. I just didn't like all the commotion associated with young people coming and going in and out of the house. I was afraid and wanted my simple, quiet, spoiled rotten life back,as one can understand.\nAfter two months, I was given up on, thrown out and taken to the local animal shelter. So as you can see, I went from \"The Princess to The Pauper\".\n\nThings got much worse for me at the shelter because I was put into a single 4x6 room with concrete floors and cylinder block walls. I was terrified, so terrified in fact that I growled at the animal control officers and would try to bite them. They labeled me \"Devil Dog\".\n\nThank goodness Yorkie Haven Rescue learned of my terrible situation and came to rescue me. I was given to my Foster Mommy in a crate and driven straight to my Foster home. Foster Mommy took me outside and let me out of my crate. I jumped straight in her lap, tail wagging, and placed a big ole wet kiss right on her nose!\n\nFoster Mommy says I am a good girl, very loyal and protective. She also calls me an alpha female, whatever that means! I went to the dogtor the next day and had a perfectly clean bill of health. The next day we were off to the groomer to get a nice bath and haircut. Whew! I feel like a new woman!!!\nIn my Foster home there are two other female yorkies and a 2 year old human child, all three of which I am NOT A FAN! I would prefer to be the only baby in the house...that means no other doggies or children to take away from my attention.\n\nIf you are looking for a lifelong, loyal, lapdog- I am the girl for you!\n\nSending you tail wags and kisses!\nBubbles\nBub",

If we could figure out a way to spend some quality time together, there are so many cool things I could show you. For example, did you know that there's a dog beach in Asbury Park?  Dogs are allowed on the Boardwalk and on the 8th avenue Dog Beach all day between 9/15 and 5/15.  It's a really nice place to go in the cool weather, especially at night!  I could show it to you! Have you ever hiked up at Ramapo Mountain State Forest?  That's another cool place I could take you, there are so many beautiful trails, (and fall foliage is coming!), you can even hike up to some ruins!  I'll bet you think you know your neighborhood like the back of your hand, but you've never walked it with me, I'll show you all kinds of cool stuff that you probably never noticed before!  Do you like going for rides?  I dig rides!  If you'll drive, I'll ride shotgun, we can go on road trips together or maybe some snack runs on movie night! There's so much fun stuff we could do,  I'm getting excited just thinking about it!\n\nYou know, I think I may have figured out a way.  FOSTER to ADOPT!  We could try it!  If you'll come to HQ and get me, I can come and stay at your house for a few days or even a week or two if you want. It would be like a really long sleepover! Doesn't that sound like fun?  Oh, one more thing, do you know how to give a belly rub?\n\nOh man, I can't wait 'til you get here!\"  ~Dee Dee\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to foster, foster-to-adopt, (in case you're not sure), or adopt sweet DEE DEE, just fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION, which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein Yoall animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/\n",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING PRINCESS ANNA, GO TO THE MAKE A DIFFERENCE RESCUE FACEBOOK PAGE AND SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE THAT INCLUDES YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS.\n\nPrincess Anna is a 5.5 year old Cattle Dog mix. Princess Anna was a pregnant stray wandering the streets. Make A Difference Rescue was notified about her and we quickly rescued her. She had her babies in February 2018 just before Valentine's day. Princess Anna is now ready to start the next chapter of her life. She is a very sweet and gentle girl. Princess Anna loves to go for walks, go for car rides or just hang out with people. Children 7 years old or older. She is good with other dogs after a proper introduction is done. Unfortunately, we do not know how she is with cats. Her forever home must have a fenced yard where she can safely run and play. Princess Anna is spayed, up to date on her vaccinations, on monthly heart worm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Princess cannot wait to be part of a very loving family!!\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters.  Princess Anna's adoption fee is $275.",

            "description": "If you are looking for a guy who will be your snuggle buddy, Tucker is IT!  He loves nothing more than to be the center of your universe!  He is living at our sanctuary and when he gets his turn at being in the living room he expects that he will get your undivided attention and makes it clear to all who are with him.  If someone chooses to be on the computer instead, he will tolerate it for a while but then he will come over and gently lay his head on their arm and remind them of who is the priority!\n\nShould it be his turn in one of the exercise yards he forgets all about snuggling and is all about the balls!  He is learning that he can trade for a second ball and give up the one that he has.  Tucker is very smart, has gone thru  our Companions I and II classes and enjoys showing his skills to all who will watch.  \n\nIf Tucker could answer the question of where he would like to live I suspect it would go something like this-\"I want to be the only dog in the house and I certainly do not want to share my space with a cat!!  I'll share a couch but I want my own crate!  A fenced in yard is my happy place!\"  He does need experienced dog owners, adults or teens.  \n\nBecause he needs a fenced in yard and needs to be the only animal, a single family home is also going to fit him best.  He would not be a good fit for an apartment or a condo.  \n\n\nSome stats on this guy-he is 74 lbs., and is 8 years old, is crate trained.\n\nCall us at Our Companions Animal Rescue and Sanctuary at 860-242-9999 or e-mail to daryl@ourcompanions.org to get more information on Tucker!!  You can also go to www.ourcompanions.org and see more pictures and more description of him on the adoption page!",

            "description": "Meet Coco!\n\nCoco is a sweet love bug who looking to be someone\u2019s best friend. Need a running partner? Coco is your girl. Want someone to warm your side while you mellow on the couch and watch TV? Coco can do that too. She has such a big heart and is ready to steal yours. Who doesn\u2019t want to come home to a big bundle of love who acts like you coming home is the best present they\u2019ve ever received?\n\nAn energetic dog, Coco would do best in a home with a yard with a privacy fence where she can run. It may take her a bit to warm to other dogs, but once she does, they are her best friends and she loves to play. Her favorite past times are walks, tug of warm and wrestling, though she can be a couch potato when she feels like it. For the previous reasons, Coco would also do well in a home with other dogs and older children. While she doesn\u2019t mean to, she may be too strong and outgoing for smaller children. She also is a leash puller, so she will need someone who can handle her strength.\n\nCoco has no issues going into her kennel when needed, is gentle about taking treats, and is not food aggressive. That being said, if she can reach it, she will take it if given the chance. She may have been picked up as a stray but she behaves well and learns quickly. She responds best to audible cues rather than words. That being said, she would do best in a home with someone who can be patient with her while she learns to navigate her way in the world. \n\n\nOur Adoption Process: \n*You must complete an adoption application before meeting an animal.\n*We do all checks on references and vet checks.  \n*Please let your references know we will be calling. \n*Once approved, you can set up an appointment to meet any of the animals at the Granite City Animal Control, or the ones in foster homes. \n*There will be a meet and greet and then a home visit.\n*After that you will sign an adoption contract and pay the adoption fee.  \n\n$85 for Rabbits / $80 for Cats / $100 Kittens / $150 for Dogs / $200 for Puppies Six Months & Under\n\nThe dog adoption application is located here:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/31997643682166\n\nAll our animals are completely vetted with the required vaccinations, microchipped and spayed/neutered before leaving the rescue. \nIncluding: \nCats will have FIV/FeLV testing\nDogs will have Heartworm testing\nRabbits will have a wellness check \n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n\nMany times we also get feral cats or semi-friendly cats (can be petted but doesn't like to be held) needing barn homes. You will need to provide shelter and food. There are not any adoption fees for barn cats (donations are accepted) but you will still need to fill out the cat adoption form. Just list the number of barn cats you are wanting.  \n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nWe are a small foster based rescue but some of our animals are residing at the Granite City Animal Control in Madison County, Illinois until they can be adopted, fostered or pulled by another rescue. \n\nPound Pets Inc Rescue can always use more fosters.\nIf you are interested in fostering, the foster application is located here:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/50784968756173\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nPound Pets volunteers cleans the animal control building, we are the caregivers for the animals brought in. Once they come through the door, they become our responsibility. We photograph all animals and post to the Pound Pets Facebook page. We provide them clean kennels, beds, blankets, toys, treats, outside play time, walks and human interaction. We try to comfort the scared, keep the high-energy ones exercised and provide plenty of love and affection to make their time at animal control as less stressful as possible. \n\nSometimes they get reclaimed by their families and sometimes they don't. If they don't it is our responsibility to find the adopters, fosters or rescues to save them from euthanasia. \n\nWe get in sick and injured animals as well. They do not sit in their kennels or cages needing veterinary care. Once we see the need for care they are taken to the vet. Sometimes the illness or injury is minor and the city will cover the bill, Other times when it's not, we do. We do all of this on our own dime. We buy the food, the beds, the blankets, the toys, and all the other things that go into care for the animals. Sometimes things are donated and that is wonderful!! We pay the medical bills that the city doesn't. As with most animal controls, there is a limit on what they will do or cover. At Pound Pets, there is no limit. Broken Bones, Surgery, Parvo, Heartworm, etc., if the animal has a chance the animal is given that chance. This is not a shelter but an animal control. \n\nPound Pets Inc Rescue can always use more volunteers.\nIf you are interested in volunteering, the volunteer application is located here:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/40307066949156\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nWe are always looking for licensed rescues to pull cats (including FIV+ cats) and dogs from the Granite City Animal Control in Madison County, Illinois. It's a very small animal control and strays keep coming in.  There are no fees for a rescue to pull. If you can help us, please email the volunteers at poundpetsinc@gmail.com \n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nPound Pets Inc Animal Control Facebook Page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/poundpetsincorporated/\n\nPound Pets Inc Rescue Facebook Page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/poundpetsincrescue/",

            "description": "Sheldon is a 9-year-old, 64 pound Pitbull/basset mix. Black with white. He is house trained, however, we say that every dog needs a refresher course in their forever home. He's a friendly, lovable guy. Loves playing with toys and knows some commands, such as 'sit.' He is very smart and so much fun to hang with and play ball....one of his favorite activities.\nOur teenage volunteers who spent time with him say that he is a very good dog. He just needs some work on the leash, since he's a puller. Got a definite Bassett 'bend in his front legs.' Watch his video and his fun time!\nHe has all his medical records, microchip - came from a home where he was much loved. His owner died of cancer, and Sheldon was so gentle when the man was in a wheelchair. He was also great with the toddler.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

She has not had her ears or tail cropped, and looks prettier because she is au natural.\nShe gets along well with other dogs and does walk on a leash but she pulls a little.  An \"easy walker harness\" would take care of that!\n\nFilling out an application is the first step in the adoption process. If you have questions, the best way to contact us is to email azdesertrottis@aol.com.\n\nWe don't always bring all animals to our adoption events so check ahead of time to make sure the animal you are interested in is still available. Some animals listed may already be promised.\n\nArizona Desert Rotti & Pals Rescue is a NO KILL rescue serving Tucson and the surrounding area. \n\nWe do adopt out of area under the right circumstances. If you are willing to travel to Tucson to meet us, and to personally transport your adopted pet home, we may be willing to work with you. \n\nA home visit is usually required for the safety of our animals. We check the yard to make sure this girl cannot escape, no predator can get in, and also look for hazardous plants. \n\nWe do not adopt our dogs out unless you have a secured, fenced yard, it\u2019s a requirement for the safety of the dog. At the end of the application, please include the type of fencing and the height of the fence you have around your yard. \n\nIf you're interested in Wiya or any of our dogs, please fill out a pre application at: http://www.azdesertrotti.com/html/to_adopt.htm\nOnce you have filled out the pre-adoption application, someone will contact you about the dog to answer your questions and tell you where our Sunday adoption event is held.\n\nOur dogs are bathed, dewormed, vet checked, given their required shots, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. \n\nOur rescues are homed with foster parents. They are fostered in homes so that we can tell you a little bit about their personalities, feeding schedule, habits, behavior, whether they get along with other dogs. We can tell you if they are crate trained, if they are leash trained and house trained. Most dogs need a refresher course on potty training when they go to a new home. They need to learn your routine, and it will be up to you to teach them. \n\nEven the most abused animals can be wonderful pets. It takes patience, love and good food, along with fun and commitment to the animal. Fosters work with these animals. They are a part of our families, while we are lucky enough to have them.",

We always recommend a meet and greet with any resident dogs. At the shelter and while on leash, Beethoven met a dog-friendly cat and he was appropriate. We always recommend caution when introducing a dog to resident cats because behavior can be different in a home. From spending time with Beethoven at the shelter and from one brief adoption we have observed that Beethoven can be protective of his human friends. We believe Beethoven would do well in a quiet home that doesn't have a lot of visitors. Please call for more information or to make an appointment to meet Beethoven. (Updated 1/30/21).",

He is so sweet and of course he enjoys belly rubs. Buddy is the perfect dog for a family and we hope to get him in a home with children.  If you are interested in adopting Buddy Boy,  please follow the link and complete an application.  \n\nAll our adoption fee of $150  includes spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies. All of our pets are either tested heart-worm negative OR are currently being treated with the slow kill method approved by our veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention.\n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://mustluvdogs.org/adoption-application/\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority but not all of our pets require a fenced yard.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and Good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport a puppy under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees at a low $150, but any additional donations are appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meeting for any of fur-babies. Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events. They are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails.\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heart-worm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and micro-chipped.\n\n",

He is slowly coming along. All those nerves and muscle are awake and the PT team is still trying to figure out how we can get him in touch with them again. This week we will start cupping therapy on his hips and see how that helps him. He loves his therapy, wheel chairs and water therapy on the treadmill. Found the creek in our property with his sister Kodah , they are the dynamic duo.\n\nI just arrived in Virginia on April 12th.\n\nIf you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know.

Unfortunately, his owners had to move and couldn\u2019t take him with them so we offered to take him and find him a new home. Duke is about 8 years old. He\u2019s a very laid back boy but will need time to adjust to a new situation. He would do best with an experienced owner that can provide calm, consistent guidance as he adjusts.  He is not playful with other dogs but would make a quiet, laid back companion for an older dog, He Does not do well with cats or small dogs.  Because he can be a bit nervous in new situations, we also feel he would do best in a home with no children. He loves car rides and long walks and also likes playing in water. He would do best in a home with consistent day-to-day activity. He does not do well with a lot of changes. He needs to have a fenced yard. He is housebroken and crate trained. Duke is neutered, HW checked and up to date on shots. For more information, please contact tamjov9@aol.com.",

Visit our FAQ webpage for commonly asked questions about our adoption/foster process.\n\n\"A dark eyed beauty with a smile all her own.\"\nHi! I'm Ellie, a sweet, affectionate girl who is on a journey to find my forever home. I was rescued from an abandoned yard and am so excited to have an opportunity to find a family that I can love.\nTraining and trust have been key on the road to my transformation from orphan to loyal companion. I'm learning how to interact properly with dogs of various sizes, and how to listen to my handler when distractions exist. I know many commands, such as sit, stay, shake, no, come, go potty, down, roll over, and give kisses. I'm house trained, leash trained and crate trained.\nI love as much positive attention as possible, (who doesn't?) and am not certain I want to share your affection with other animals. I like Nylabones, Kong toys and real bones but have a hard time sharing such treats with canine buddies. (I never got any before I was rescued.) A home where I can be the sole shining canine star would be ideal.\nI've been described as very affectionate, (I love cuddles!), sensitive, and mostly submissive. I can be insecure when it comes to loud noises, such as thunderstorms and fireworks. My future owners will need to be patient and kind, and continue with my training and socialization.\nI'm a sweet girl who is longing for a home where I'll never be left behind again. Can you help me complete my journey and make my dreams of a loving home come true?\nFor more information or questions, email Tim at tmb611@msn.com.\nClick here to watch a video of Ellie.Last Day Dog Rescue now microchips all animals before adoption. Microchips are implanted between the animals shoulder blades and are a permanent form of identification. The microchips are registered to Last Day Dog Rescue with the adopter's info added once adopted. If the animal is ever lost and slips his/her collar/tags the microchip allows the finder to know who to contact if scanned for a microchip. Animals MUST still have a collar with tags on at all times. Per our contract, we take all our animals back if for any reason you can't keep your adopted animal.\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal. The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home. While the animal might be good with the current foster's dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children. The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home. The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting. Please understand that statements made regarding this animal are simply overviews and are not guaranteed.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our animals. Visual breed identification in animals is unreliable so for most of the animals we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each animal as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our animals based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nThank you for looking through our list of animals needing forever homes and choosing rescue first. We appreciate you stopping by.",

Visit our FAQ webpage for commonly asked questions about our adoption/foster process.\n\nWell, hello there, welcome to my page!\nWhat's that, you are here looking for a dog to be your furever buddy! Well that is AMAZING because I am a dog. And guess what!? I am looking for my furever buddy too! Isn't that great!\nMy name is Mazzie. My foster dad just can't stop raving about me! He says I am such a wonderful dog with so much happiness and energy to go around. That couldn't be more true! I play so well with my foster pals, not so good with cats, but definitely love my doggie friends! I will need slow and proper introductions to my new doggie friends.\nI love to be active with you, but once I have my nylabone, it is my zen time! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE playing fetch and tug!\nNeed some cuddles and a good kiss, I got that covered. If you adopt me {Raises right paw}, I promise to always have your back no matter what. I promise to always give you the love and attention that we both can handle. It would make me the happiest dog on earth to become a part of your family!\nI really hope that I get to meet you soon!\nEagerly awaiting your furever lap!\nMazzie! P.S. - I really hope you have a fenced in yard for me to play in.\nFor more information or questions, email Tim at tmb611@msn.com.\nClick here to watch a video of Mazzie.Last Day Dog Rescue now microchips all animals before adoption. Microchips are implanted between the animals shoulder blades and are a permanent form of identification. The microchips are registered to Last Day Dog Rescue with the adopter's info added once adopted. If the animal is ever lost and slips his/her collar/tags the microchip allows the finder to know who to contact if scanned for a microchip. Animals MUST still have a collar with tags on at all times. Per our contract, we take all our animals back if for any reason you can't keep your adopted animal.\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal. The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home. While the animal might be good with the current foster's dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children. The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home. The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting. Please understand that statements made regarding this animal are simply overviews and are not guaranteed.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our animals. Visual breed identification in animals is unreliable so for most of the animals we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each animal as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our animals based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nThank you for looking through our list of animals needing forever homes and choosing rescue first. We appreciate you stopping by.",

            "description": "Meet Keaton! He is a 5-6 year old mastiff mix looking for his forever home. Keaton is a big teddy bear, weighing in at 95 lbs, who loves to snuggle and thinks he is a lap dog. Keaton is dog reactive and prefers to be the only pet. He was found during the polar vortex in January 2019 by a good Samaritan, emaciated and in rough shape. She took him to safety and Hope Marie stepped in to provide the medical care, including eye surgery, to get him healthy and ready for his forever home. We don't think he has lived indoors much of his life and has separation anxiety when left alone. We are working on this with him as well as some other manners so he can be the best boy possible. Keaton would do best in a home that will be patient and will continue his training. While Keaton does very well with children, he is not aware of his size so a home without small children would be best for him.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting from HMF. All of our pets are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, microchipped and otherwise healthy, unless noted in the description. Our adoption area is within 50 miles of Franklin/Bargersville, IN.\n\nWe hold a monthly adoption event on the last Saturday of each month from 12:00 noon until 3:00 p.m. at the new Center Grove Pet Valu store.\n5885 N St Rd 135 Bargersville IN\n\nDirect questions to: general@hopemariesfund.org",

I need to be the only dog in the house as I get jealous when you pay attention to the other pets. One of the volunteers has been working with me on my leash skills for the last couple of weeks and I've really come a long way and am doing MUCH better. I am a smart boy and learn quickly if you just take your time with me. There were no kids in the home where I was staying, so not sure how I feel about them.

I'm actually happy, sweet, very active and phenomenally adorable once I get to know and trust you but I intensely dislike being confined in a crate and will react by growling or nipping when being put in or taken out of the crate. I can be dog and person selective; if I like you then we're okay. If not, I can be reactive and could even nip. Because I have this issue, it is recommended that my forever family DOES NOT INCLUDE CHILDREN . I would do best in a home with a low level of stimulation; a calmer, quiet, environment would be ideal but with a space to use my boundless energy. I enjoy playing with my foster in a fenced yard so that would be a must for my new home. I'm curious about my foster family's cat but I'm not sure what could happen if I ever had the chance to interact with them. I am spayed, up-to-date on Rabies and yearly vaccines, heartworm negative and microchipped. I'm ready to go to a home who can with time, love, appreciation of my high energy level and patient experienced training will help me be all that I can and should be.

            "description": "**See more pictures of Mr. Big and his entire journey with us on his Facebook album**\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/forgottendogsrescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2359870957365021\n\nAre you looking for your one and only to walk off into the sunset with?  Well, Mr. Big is your guy!  After seven months in his foster home, he is ready to find his forever true love!  Are you his Carrie?\n \nMr. Big has quite the story.  We found him at the Yakima Humane Society in March 2019, where he had been picked up as a stray, and the second we met him, we knew he was leaving with us. While not 100% sure of his past, the scars on his body and the overall shape he was in when we got him into the rescue tells of a pretty tough history.  He came to us with many wounds from past dog fights, some of which were newer, others were much older.  He had entropion eyelids in both eyes, plus tears on the eyelids of both eyes.  His left eye was also ruptured. He hadn\u2019t received care for this injury and he no longer had sight from that eye.  In addition, all four of his canines all of his top and bottom incisors were broken and the roots badly infected. All of these had to be removed, a total of 17 teeth. He was underweight, had some skin issues, a torn ACL, and had a large slit in his lower lip that was from a previous injury and hadn\u2019t been fixed when it happened.  \n \nObviously, it took us quite a bit to get Big into better shape.  The wounds healed over time, we removed his ruptured left eye and repaired his eyelids, removed the necessary teeth and repaired his ACL.  Getting him into physical shape was only part of the journey we have been on with Mr. Big, however.  Given his unknown and, seemingly, difficult past we have taken some extra time to get to know him in terms of how he is with people and other dogs.  It was no surprise that he has some behaviors to work on and manage.  \n \nTo this end, he will need a special adopter and, given what he has been through, he deserves someone who will understand him and give him what he needs to stay happy, healthy and safe.  \n \nBig\u2019s age has been estimated between 8-10 years old.  And, in several ways he is definitely an old dude.  His favorite things are laying on the couch, napping and laying on the couch. ;)  Also, he likes to sniff and stroll around the yard and roll around a bit while he is out there.  Big, also, LOVES car rides. From the second he came to us, all Big wanted to do was go for a ride.  Seeing his face roll along on his first car ride out of the shelter was one of the best things to see ever. He just loves watching the world go by! \n \nMr. Big is a big (80 pounds!) stubborn boy, and he is not a dog that automatically gives respect, you have to earn it.  Big learned to respect his foster mom within a couple of weeks due to her providing consistent boundaries and structure.  Once he learned to respect her, he got to get up on the couch for cuddles and all of the snuggles.  He will likely push some boundaries in a new home by invading personal space in inappropriate ways.  But, once his respect is earned, he is a wonderful gentleman!  \n \nAs with manners inside the house, Mr. Big is also learning appropriate leash manners outside the house. Much like in the home, Big will try to be the boss and want to charge ahead wherever he wants to go.  Again, he is stubborn!  After a bit of negotiation and setting clear boundaries he will walk (mostly) politely by your side.  He doesn\u2019t need a lot of activity and after a 15-20 minute walk, he will want to go home and take a nap.  Or, lay on the couch.  \n \nDue to his past and his observed reaction to other dogs outside of his foster home, Mr. Big needs a home with no other dogs or animals.\n\nMr. Big is crate trained and house trained.\n\nHis adoption fee is $350, and he is neutered, up to date with vaccinations, and microchipped.

Roxy was picked up by animal control with a chain collar embedded around her neck (before pictures can be provided upon request). The officers immediately rushed her to our vet where she underwent surgery to remove the collar. Weeks later, her stitches have been removed, the wounds completed healed and she has just a few small scars to show the ordeal she endured. You would think Roxy might hold a grudge against humans for what was done to her but she feels exactly the opposite. She loves people and wants nothing more than to be right where ever the people are-dogs really are the most forgiving of creatures. She loves children and is great with other dogs but we have learned she wants to play too roughly for cats. She really is a special dog and deserves a special home. Roxy is up to date with shots, spayed, crate trained, negative for heartworms and on prevention. If you think you can provide a loving home to Roxy, please visit our website at www.myhstc.org to submit an adoption application..\n\nAdoption fee is $85 which includes all veterinary care\n\nIf you have never adopted from us before, we prescreen all applicants prior to meeting our pets. To be screened, please visit our website at www.myhstc.org to submit an application.",

            "description": "When we first rescued Marcus, (the day he was going to be euthanized) he had numerous puncture wounds believed to be from a pellet gun and/or dog bites, apparent chemical burns, cuts and tears, and malnourished at 20 lbs underweight. Yet even after all that, he is SO sweet to humans. \n    \nWe were asked to help Marcus because the folks at the shelter saw that this sweet guy did not deserve to be put down!! Now Marcus is in a foster home where he is able to be a normal dog, He is able to have frequent training and lots of love, attention, and exercise- which is what every happy dog needs! Marcus is about 4 years old, and now weighs about 55 lbs.\n\nMarcus is extremely affectionate and eager to please people. He definitely will need to be in a home with a fenced in back yard. Marcus loves to be outside and roll in the grass, and he gets very excited about squeaky toys!  Marcus needs to be the only dog in the home.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting or adopting Marcus, email safepaws.florida@gmail.com.  Inquiries in Pinellas County please\n\nPlease note, we are not a shelter. We do not have a kennel or facility that you can visit and see all the dogs. Each dog is fostered in an individual home. We do rescue out of our private homes and in our spare time. So, you cannot come visit our dogs until you have gone through the application and interview process and we have contacted you about scheduling a visit.  We do not have set \"hours\" and we answer all calls and emails as quickly as we can.\n",

            "description": "Must be within 1 hour drive of Essington, PA 19029, have another small dog or a dog friendly cat (Rylee loves cats), also a fenced yard is required ~ Cute Rylee was brought into a local high risk shelter after her last human passed away.  The shelter is a scary place for most but for a small pooch used to a home with a person that loved her, we can only imagine what went through her mind, which showed through her actions.  Rylee was acting out in the only way she knew how to protect herself, and that was trying to not allow people near her by being nippy & growly.  She didn't stand much of a chance getting adopted that way so PLDP pulled her into a foster home.  Trying not to let the same behavior start foster mom went super slow with her.  After a few days Rylee finally decided to come out of her crate with the help of her foster brother, and since has settled in her foster home. Because she has a few nips under her belt, we are recommending an adult only home.   Rylee gets along with most of the other dogs in the foster care but can be a little selective, but we believe she will be most happy with a fur-sibling so we are requiring another dog (about the same size as Rylee) in the house, or at least a playful cat so she has a buddy.  Rylee does enjoy playing with the friendly cats and kittens.  Rylee will sleep in her crate, on the sofa in in bed sometimes, foster mom tries not to let them get too spoiled in case rules are different in a forever home..  She is 100% PP pad trained, so not sure if she will ever get the hang of being housebroken.  Rylee likes to play chase with other pups, enjoys chewing on bully sticks, being brushed and seems to like being dressed up :) She hasn't had much leash experience.  Rylee is about 3YO, and she weighs about 8 pounds. If you think you are a good fit for our Rylee, please go to our website www.pldpaws.org and complete an application.  Rylee is spayed, chipped, UTD and heartworm neg.",

She loves to play with the big dogs and thinks the small dogs are too boring. She has the full JRT personality. She is very loving, but does not feel safe if you try to pick her up. Her foster family is working on this with her, but for now she is muzzled for nail trims, the rare bath, and vet visits. She is great on the leash and prefers a harness to a collar. She knows her name and responds to it very well. Her ideal home would be with a moderately active family with children over 10, that will take her on several walks a day. She is house-trained, but as all dogs do, will require time to adjust to a new schdule and situation. She is fully vaccinated, micro-chipped, and will be spayed before adoption.",

He does have energy and needs structured exercise, but he can't go forever so if you're looking for a dog who can climb mountains with you, it's not Kobe.\n\nHe\u2019s very friendly with the people he knows and trusts, but that list is short, and he is weary of strangers. He needs slow introductions to new people in order to warm up to them. Kobe will need an adopter that understands his need to take things slow, both with new people and new environments. \n\nKobe is dog selective. He is not a dog who you should be taking to the dog park or anywhere where there is loose, unstructured play with random dogs, but he will definitely do well living with another dog or having dog friends that he is introduced too properly that is of a good temperament. He does not like dogs who are super in his face. He also does okay with cats, as long as the interactions are monitored.\n\nKobe is well trained, knows basic commands, walks well on leash, travels well in the car and has pretty good manners around the house. He loves his crate as well. \n\nHis ideal home is a home with one or two adults only and possibly another well balanced dog. Kobe is a follower and he will pick up another dogs bad habits, as well as bounce energy off of them. For this reason, he should live with a dog who is secure and even keeled, not anxious or a dog with behavioral issues. Whoever adopts him should be comfortable handling him and advocating for his space when necessary. He needs someones lead to follow. Because of his low confidence and general distrust of the world, he can make poor decisions when left to is own devices. That's where structure, rules and guidance will come into play to help him navigate the world around him! He will have lifelong training support, but needs someone who is open to our guidance and can follow our instruction.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT INQUIRE ABOUT KOBE IF:\n-ANYONE under 18 lives in your home\n-You have roommates\n-You are against crates\n-You are not open to balanced training\n\nIf you're interested in Kobe, email us at caredogvolunteers@gmail.com.\n\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: All dogs are in foster care all over MA. They are NOT at the cat shelter, which is the address listed on Petfinder. There are ONLY cats there. We do not set up meet and greets with dogs until after you've been approved to adopt. Please do not email asking us if you can come by and meet a dog the same day.*",

She absolutely adores her humans and is incredibly loving - she appreciates every car ride, walk, pet, snuggle and even just being fed because it means she is getting attention. Xena is a very easy dog to have around and is house trained, completely trustworthy with free roam of the house when alone, knows sit, and is extremely treat and praise motivated so she would love to learn some new tricks if you are willing to teach her. She would do great with older kids (doesn't realize her size with the little ones) and will be the most loving and loyal companion around. Her only fault is that she can be reactive to strange dogs when first meeting and doesn't like to share her food with other dogs. Xena could live with the right other large dog (no small dogs or cats please) if her humans were willing to do slow, proper introductions and manage the environment by feeding separately and not giving bones together. She would also love to be the only dog where she can be the apple of your eye!\n\nTo see the most up to date status on this dog, visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com.",

I'm a sugar sweet friendly easy going boy and am nice to everyone I meet.. I'm not pushy or demanding. I'm the perfect gentleman and like all Boxers, I'm a \"leaner\" and I'll lean into you to claim you.  I know basic commands and am eager to learn more as I'm a good listener and want to please. I don't go on the couch unless I'm invited and I'm not destructive but don't really like being left alone. I'm super loving and a SNUGGLEBUG and love to cuddle next to you. My one bad vice is that I have \"prey drive\" so NO CATS & NO SMALL DOGS for me. I'm fine with kids in passing but best to be with older kids ages 8 yrs +. I seem to be fine with calm dogs bigger especially another BOXER but I'm best as a SOLO dog so I can get all the attention. That said, my ideal home would be with folks that know my breed, are medium active and live in the country with a fenced in yard that have another large easy going dog to keep me company or are home alot. If you fit the bill pls come meet me today!!\n\nFor more info/application: pls email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

            "description": "Meet Buster! Buster is spunky and looking for a forever home of his own as an only dog. Buster has decided blankets, beds, and laps are his favorite things in all the world. He craves human affection. He has received training from our behaviorist and is a smart boy that aims to please! He is strong so no young kids. He loves to get pets and snuggle and go for walks. He wants a fenced in yard to play in in his forever home.\nWe rescued Buster from Pasco County Animal Services in terrible shape. This poor boy is the product of severe neglect. The first time we met Buster, he was 100% without hair and covered in scabs. But, he was kind. He would wag his tail when you approached his kennel and stare right into your eyes.\nFast forward several months with devoted skin care and treatments from his foster family, Buster Brown is looking wayyyyyy better. We recently tested the remaining scabs/scarred areas with punch biopsies and learned that in those areas still without hair growth, it's quite possible that the severe case of dermatitis has made it impossible to clear fully or grow hair in certain spots.\n\nWhat this means is, Buster will always retain some of the outward reminders of his horrible past. You will always be able to see a glimpse into the horror he suffered prior to joining the Maxx&Me family. What it also means is that Buster will always have a prominent and obvious testament to how far he has come. He beat death. He beat sickness. He beat the pain.\nBuster is neutered, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. If you can be Buster's buddy please complete an adoption application at www.maxxandme.org! His adoption donation is only $225.\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

A gorgeous 55-pound shepherd-lab mix born in 2016, Apollo was found on the harsh streets of Texas with a severe break to his front leg that required amputation, given the damage from being left untreated. Don't worry though, because Apollo has adjusted beautifully as a tripod! Despite the suffering he has endured, he remains sweet, loving and so very friendly to people and other dogs! Apollo is a couch potato but would thrive in a home with a fenced yard for his fun moments. Apollo can be a bit independent and may need some space until he gets comfortable. After that, be prepared to give belly rubs! He is a bit nervous around small children, and although he peacefully coexists with his foster cat sibling, he sometimes will engage the cat in a game of chase. He is housetrained, leash trained and neutered--no crate for this boy! A house with no stairs, or just a few carpeted stairs, would be best and Apollo needs short walks due to a torn ACL in another leg. Apollo's favorite things are\nchew toys, belly rubs and kisses. He absolutely hates goats and flies!\nIf you would like to be the lucky one who gets to give this beautiful golden-eyed boy his happy ever after, please fill out an adoption application for Apollo here!

She loves to be outside and run through the grass with her foster pups in tow. She is good with everyone and everything once she is given a second to meet you. She loves being held and petted. She has the personality of a Rottweiler when she first meets you and then it is ALL love from there! If you're looking for a dog that will keep you laughing, she is your girl. She did have a back injury that she was either born with or happened during or shortly after birth and is unable to hold her urine or her bowels, so you have to be willing to give her baths often. She is unable to wear a normal doggie diaper, as she only has 2 front legs. She stands on her front legs to drink, eat, run and even jumps out the door to go potty with her fur foster pups.

Please search\n#WeareWyattsWarriors\nto read about his journey.\n\nWyatt... This boy we affectionately call, Mr. Handsome is searching for his forever family. He is a lab/great dane mix that will be 5 years old in August. Unfortunately... he will need a very special family that will be able to attend to his daily care. He is paralyzed from the waste back. He has use of only one front leg. He is able to scoot himself around to his food, water or anywhere else he is determined to go. Watch it when you run the bathwater... he will end up in the bathroom too! He LOVES toys!! Here is his newest obsession... a little baby blankie with a lamb. He MUST have toys to keep him mentally stimulated and active. He is a happy boy that would love nothing more than you to lay with him and pet him from morning to night. You will have to be able to relieve his bladder and bowels as needed, every 4 hours and he does express urine and poo throughout the day. This all is no easy task as he is almost 100 lbs. We need your help to find the perfect home. He would do well with a cat or a dog but needs a calmer home than his current foster family. He gets frustrated when the other dogs go out to potty... he would love to go with them. Other than potty time... Wyatt is just like any other pup who likes to play, be petted, and snooze throughout the day. We want the BEST home ever for this handsome fella. Someone who will be able to give him lots of love and attention. He deserves a family to call his own. Applications are available on our website\nwww.onedogatatime.us\n, if you feel you can accommodate Wyatt and his special needs.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nDeitz is a 7 yr old American bulldog mix who is true to his breed. When he is not playing hard, he just wants to cuddle and warning... he thinks he is a lap dog. He enjoys chewing on bones, deer antlers, and playing with squeaky toys. A fenced yard would be ideal for his energy. If no fence, daily exercise would be a must for him. He rides great in the car and would be a great dog for hikes and long walks. At 7 years old, this boy still has lots of energy and love to share. He would do best in a calmer home without a lot of people in and out. He does good with medium to large dogs, small dogs we would not recommend. He is not good with cats. Older/considerate kids would be best for him to play with since he is a solid boy. He seems to do best with women and is slow to warm up to men, but once he trusts you, you're golden. He came to ODAAT after his human Mom passed away in their home. Deitz stayed by her side for days until they were found by family and sadly the family was unable to keep him. Understandably so, he will be protective of your family. He would never want to lose you. If you think Deitz would be a great addition to your family, please apply on our website at\n\nwww.onedogatatime.us",

Chance would do best in a quiet home with no cats and possibly a calm quiet female dog. Toddlers make him nervous so he would do better with older children. He loves following his foster parents around his big fenced in yard and will play with you with a toy. He also loves going on walks and car rides .

Benji has since been adopted.\n\nThor has a white-and-brown short smooth coat, a long tail, and a gorgeous face with a large patch of brown around his right eye, a liver-colored nose, and short semi-erect ears.\n\nThor weighs approximately 60 lbs and is very strong on the other end of a leash. He wanted attention so badly when he was outdoors for his Petfinder/Facebook photos.\n\nIn compliance with the Ohio Revised Code, Sebastian (aka Thor) will be held for three days. He will be available for adoption on April 11, 2019 if he is not reclaimed.\n\nUPDATE: Thor was neutered on April 29, 2019 and was also given rabies vaccine.\n\n",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks. 86 lb Akita boys can still be sensitiveOakley says there's not a word yet for FRIENDS who've just met. He had an injury to his right ear, but he's in good spirits now that he's been rescued and healed. Oakley is learning many things at the ranch, like sit and how to walk on leash... it appears he has never had a safe loving home where he was taught his basic commands and could trust he would have a regular meal. Sometimes he can be little cautious with new people but once he trusts you are his friend, he is open to learning what it means to receive love. He will cuddle up and LOVES a good long scratch under his chin. Oakley would be best as an only dog.

I have great focus and I know lots of tricks ..I would love to learn some more. I am nervous around new people and I am still learning some manners, but I love to go for long walks, car rides, or to sleep in the lounge chair with my human. I'd prefer a home with a huge yard and no other dogs or cats please.\n\nDoes Tina like other pets?\n\nWhen I see other dogs out on a walk, I am not sure what to do! I bark at them, and I think I want to play, but then I'm unsure. I am going for some training to help me decide.\n\nGeneral socialization notes:\n\nI needlots of attention and exercise!I am wary of new people and will bark at them. If they are quiet and don't pay attention to me, I get used to them. Men take a little longer to warm up to,unless they are quiet and calm. I respond well to treats and redirection. I can jump really high and if you leave food out on the counter, I just have to jump up and get it. .\n\nDoes Tina like children?\n\n I love olderchildren! I love to chase them and herd them, and I feel it is my duty to watch over them. I do jump up on them, so kids over 12would be best.\n\nFavorite toys?\n\nMy favorite toy is a plastic milk jug. I tear up stuffed toys and squeakers in minutes. My foster Mom has found lots of good Kong toys for me to keep me busy.\n\nIdeal forever home?\n\n I need a family who will be with me a lot and will keep my brain and body active. I need lots of room to run so a yard would be wonderful, and I would love to be your hiking partner! I would like a family who will play games with me and maybe take me for some fun classes so I don't get bored at home.",

Robin is the little strawberry blonde sprite who never misses a thing.\n\nThey are litter mates, 6 and a half years old, spayed and housebroken.\n\nMy wish is to keep them together (although it is understood if that is something that may not happen). They are quite bonded though.\n\nThey love their soft couches, their toys and they watch TV---love love love TV!\n\nThey are extremely well mannered.\n\nThey are true people dogs. They go out for potty, sniff around a little and then want back in with their people for ear and belly rubs.\n\nThey are sweet, belly rub-loving babies who never expected to lose their momma.\"\n\nPLEASE SHARE SHARE SHARE in hopes that someone that may see this story will open their hearts and homes to these ladies.",

Lena was sadly returned to us because her and her brother are still puppies and were jumping and trying to play with the previous owner\u2019s son. Lena does need some obedience training and needs someone who is going to be patient and loving with her. She has done a trial run and when she was separated from her brother she was shy around the house. Lena loves people but she needs an adjustment period as well as to be an only dog. She will need someone who is experienced and willing to work and take time for her. \n\nShe is up to date on her boosters, spayed, and microchipped.\n\n\n",

He is a playful dog and will need a companion dog that is very sociable along with a fenced yard to play safely.  Luke says one of my his favorite things to do is drag his blankets out of his bed and watch hisfoster mom put them all back in (not sure what language she is speaking while doing that chore).  But she loves me still and I have to suffer through the hugs and kisses again, oh well!  \n\nLuke is neutered, vaccinated, and started on his preventatives. His adoption fee is $150.00  If interested in meeting him, please call/text Rhonda (336) 880-5133 or email rodogs1@gmail.com for further information.  We will require his adoptive family to own their home and have a visible fenced yard with a companion dog near his age.  \n\nThanks for your interest and hope to hear from you soon.  \n\n\n",

Her foster mom says she is a wonderful girl that is ready for her forever home. Stella needs to be the only pet in the home and will not be a \"dog park\" kind of dog. Stella's ideal home would be with a family with an older child 10+ that would love to spend the afternoons throwing balls and playing tug-o-war together. Please submit your application today!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStella Mae- We were contacted by her family that loved her very much, but were working so much that she was left home alone and their neighbors could hear her crying. We did a courtesy post since we did not have any available fosters. Well, she was rehomed and shortly after that, she was found abandoned and very underweight near the airport in Pensacola. We immediately recognized her because she has the most Amazing ears - just check out her photos. So we took her in, got her back to good health and now Stella Mae is ready for her forever home. She is about one and a half years old and is a stunning, sweet fawn colored American Bulldog. She is very sweet and would thrive as an only pet home! We want to make sure that her next home is really her forever home. Please make sure you are planning to make a commitment to keep her in your family for the rest of her life before filling out our online adoption application. Amazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Stella Mae is $150 and includes her spay, current shots, rabies, and registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to text (best) or call and leave a message at (850) 723-2037.",

She wants to be the center of all the attention Lola will love you forever. She is a very pretty lady with her lovely brindle coat and very playful and loves long walks in the woods. We will continue to work with her and hopefully can conquer some of her dog dislike but for now we're saying she must be the only pet.  Please come consider Lola she promises to love you to the moon and back! UPDATE:  Why is our Lola still here?  She is tough to meet at first but she soon warms up she is your best friend. She is doing wonderful with her dog skills and has actually made a few doggie friends, she now ignores dogs on her walks and absolutely LOVES water, splashing and even going face first underwater to retrieve her toys. Still no cats and only older children  but this dog is turning out to be the best. She has now been here over a year and really needs to find a home. Please please consider our little water pup!",

One look at his eyeliner and seductive poses will have you head over heels for this beautiful boy. He was surrendered to us from California and was in pretty rough shape. He was missing fur and was sensitive to touch, but look at him now. SWOON. He loves getting snuggles and waits patiently while his fosters wipe his paws after rainy walks. He tolerates baths and will do just about anything for treats. He knows sit, shake, high five and LOVES fetch. He still has plenty of energy for hikes and goes all out for tug-of-war. He can live with other dogs and older kids, but not cats. Call today to learn more about our prettiest pup!\n\nMiecko is current on vaccines, neutered and microchipped.",

            "description": "HAZEL is a 5 year old, female, Pit Mix that was surrendered when her owner passed away. Hazel  weighs 50 lbs  and is good on leash, but will pull if she sees a squirrel. Hazel is house trained and working on crate training. She is in foster with another dog and is doing well. We do think she would chase a cat if it ran. We are requiring a fenced yard for Hazel as she will run after squirrels and not come back. Hazel would do best in a home with older children.\n\nHazel is in love with her foster dad, but can be nervous when meeting some men, however, she does typically warm up quickly. Hazel is spayed, up to date with vaccinations, heart worm negative and microchipped.\n\nIf you would like to meet HAZEL, or for more information, please email petrescueofmercer@gmail.com \n\nPLEASE VISIT OUR WEB SITE to view our adoption policies and/or complete an online, non-binding adoption application. www.petrescueofmercer.org",

Spunky came to Camp Companion in October of 2017 and her rehab had been a continuing process. This girl is looking for a gentle and quiet home that can appreciate the amazing dog she is. Spunky needs a fenced yard and someone who likes to snuggle and wrestle in bed! Spunky spends the majority of her day in the bedroom and needs to be encouraged to go outside. The minute you are in bed, Spunky then turns into a flirty funny little girl. She then is animated and very outgoing. Spunky would do best if she had a canine companion. \n\nAdoption Fee: $280 plus tax\nApply to adopt at our website. www.campcompanion.org",

She would like a family with a quiet lifestyle - she does not do well with a lot of commotion or lots of people coming and going. She loves playtime in the yard, short walks, and is more than happy to cuddle up with you. She is a very sweet dog who had a terrible beginning in life, and we're committed to making sure that her future is way happier than her past!\n\nTo adopt please fill out the application at our website - https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application\n\nADOPTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES:\n\nOur goal is to help you find a wonderful new family member! We work closely with you to ensure that the dog you adopt will be a wonderful match for your family's make-up and lifestyle. Our adoption and foster placement processes includes an application, personal and vet reference checks, a home visit, and a meet and greet with the dog and all family members and other pets.\n\nPlacement is considered on the basis of the best interests of the dog and the best fit with the family - we do not adopt on a \"first come, first served\" basis.\n\nWe do not transport our dogs outside of the state of CT. If you live outside of CT and are able to travel to us after an application is approved, with your family and other pets, for a meet and greet and to complete the adoption in CT if that goes well, you're welcome to apply to adopt one of our dogs, as long as you live in one of the New England states. We do not adopt our dogs long-distance, or outside of the New England area.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  All of our dogs live in foster homes within the state of CT.  We do not have a facility.  For that reason we ask that you go through the application/approval process prior to a meet and greet, which is always part of our placement protocol.  We do this because we try to keep our foster families' day to day lives s uninterrupted as possible.

He gets along well with other dogs and loves running around a fenced yard with them and hanging with his people.  He was neglected previously but is looking and feeling great after his grooming and some medical care and ready to find a home where he will receive proper care throughout his life.  Email njwoof@cs.com to meet him. <p>We do not have a shelter- all our pets are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment only during the week, or at our weekly pet adoptions every Sunday at the Animal Clinic of Morris Plains from 12:30 to 3PM at 3009 Route 10 East, Morris Plains, NJ.   To help us better match a pet to your household, we request you fill out an application on our homepage www.secondchance.petfinder.com and copy and paste it into an email, or print it and bring it to our adoption day when you come.   Local inquiries only please- we do not do long distance adoptions  For the fastest response please email njwoof@cs.com if you are interested in one of our dogs..</p>\n<p>Can't adopt but still want to help this dog?  Click on the \"Sponsor Me\" button at the top of this page to donate toward his/her care!  All donations are tax-deductible and go directly toward the care of our rescue dogs.

It's really hard on her, as she's used to living in a home with all the comforts and love that come with that. Millie is a great combination of a snuggle bunny and being able to relax and at the same time, she won't say no to a nice walk. She's nervous with new people and takes a little time to warm up, so she will do best in a calm, adult household. She was an only dog all her live and we think, she would be happiest with that. She might do ok with a friendly male dog in the home. Millie is in great shape, has a clean bill of health and she's so loving. Millie is house trained, crate trained and has received obedience training. She's a petite Rottie, an ideal size!

I'm a happy go lucky gal. \n* I LOVE playing fetch and swimming\n* up to date on shots and healthy\n*spayed\n*approximately 65 pounds\nI would love nothing more than to have a home to call my own. You see, I'm in boarding right now and am very lonely. I'm such a good girl and deserve a GREAT home and not be in lonely boarding. \n\nI'd do best in a home with older children and up since I wouldn't want to accidentally knock over a little one with my goofiness and playful demeanor. I'm a staff favorite and would love to be YOUR favorite!\nEven if you don't want the commitment to formally adopt me, I am looking for a foster home as well. Or we can try a foster-to-adopt to make sure that I am the right fit. Can't wait to meet you!\n\nAlso, I have a best friend here named Aspen who is also in boarding. We love one another. Aspen is also looking for a foster or adopter as well. We are built in play mates as we can occupy the time with playing with one another. She is the one in a few of the pictures with me. I can come on my own, or with him :) Otherwise, I will want to be the only four legged baby in the household. \n\nFor more info, you can call orcontact  Dogtoli Dogs Rescue Inc 954 296-4922\n\n\n\n",

After a long day of labor, a c-section was done, only to deliver one deformed and deceased baby. Our hearts were broken. It took some time for Corona to understand and recover from not having her baby. She has now gained her weight back and is a true spitfire! Corona has the cutest smile when she is trying to get your attention. She is a very energetic girl and has to have a home where someone is with her at all times. Whether it was the loss of her baby or not, Corona gets so upset when left alone.  Because she needs work with her manners, we do not recommend a home with young children. Corona is fully vetted, heart worm negative and around 2 years old.",

She is fully committed to keeping your yard free of squirrels, being your favorite hiking buddy and snuggling you hard at the end of the day.\n\nWhile Goldi doesn't enjoy living with other dogs, she is ok hiking/walking around other dogs near as long as they don't get into her personal space.  \n\nGoldilocks prefers females to males and would love to have a single female owner. She could do okay with a female/male couple if the male of the household is patient, calm and committed to helping to trust him slowly. She will need a calm, adult only household, no kids. She has a tendency to protect the woman of the house and get nervous.  \n\nShe would love a home with a fenced yard where she can run around or a family that likes to get outside regularly for activities. Because she can be nervous of some people/ males and dog reactive, we do not think she should live in a super populated area, downtown, etc.  \n\nShe is current on her vaccinations, spayed and micro-chipped.  Her adoption fee is $250.",

Outside, he has a good bit of energy for an older guy - he is about 10 years old. Pablo can be a bit of a mouther when excited, so is not recommended for a home with small children. This canine gentleman is consistently friendly and pleasant with people. For more information please call 814 485 1579 or 301 478 3206.",

She is spayed, utd on all shots and in overall good health with no concerns.\n\nBehaviorally, Pink is young & strong and so is energetic & playful, and would thrive in a home with someone to embrace her energy. She has completed all professional training that has prepared her to adjust to a new life.  Pink is crate trained & likes to relax in her space & truly loves her toys, but would do best without small children as her toys get her very stimulated and excited. Pink spent her young life as a city girl, but shows all the signs of a pup who will thrive in a home with a yard and space for her to stretch her legs and run.  For now she is spending her days hoping her forever family searches and finds her!\n\n*Pink's adoption includes a Lifetime Training Package in Long Island\n\nPink is available for adoption through Pit of Our Souls Rescue!",

            "description": "Al, (birthdate approximately 4/01/2017) is a Shepherd mix looking for a new home. He is pretty nervous and would prefer a home without children under the age of 12. Al would also prefer to be the only dog in his new home, but will absolutely need the proper introduction if you have resident dogs. Al would also enjoy a large fenced in yard and owners who are patient and consistent to help him work on manners and leash skills. If you feel like this sweet boy is speaking to your heart, please fill out an application today!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Al is $350, which is TAX\nDEDUCTIBLE, and goes toward providing supportive services to animals in\nthe home, as well as the high cost of vetting our dogs in rescue. If you would\nlike to welcome Al into your home, please begin by submitting our Adoption\nApplication. The adoptions for all of our dogs will take place in the Omaha,\nNE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship\nor deliver the dogs. If you would like to learn more about Muddy Paws\nSecond Chance Rescue, or donate to our dogs, please visit our website at\nMuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com.

            "description": "My name is Roxy and I am yet another cute Great Pyrenees girl.  I am a considered a \"smaller pyr\" and should stay a \"medium\" sized dog based on Petfinder definition.  I was born in November 2018...plus or minus a month.  And yes, I am one of the \"March Madness\" Pyrs (the ones who came in from a less than desirable situation).\n\nI have three siblings and all four of us were  nicknamed \"the mohawk kids\" since we all have cute hairdos.  I asked the lady who posts our photos on Petfinder to post one of my younger photos so you can see how cute I was with my toy.  \n\nI am really shy and need some love and attention in a calmer household.  I'm okay with kids who are chilled out and my size and might enjoy a canine playmate, as long as he is a nice boy.  I do insist that we do a meet and greet, just to make sure.\n\nAs I've grown into my Pyr body, we've seen a few problems with my back legs.  It seems I have what is known as \"luxating patella\" or floating kneecap.  I've had one back leg operated on and am waiting to have the other one done.  best guess right now is that I won't be available for adoption until March 2021 at the earliest.\n\nI'm hoping to find the perfect home soon so I know where I'll be living in 2021.  Won't you consider making me part of your family after my surgeries and recovery is done?\n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high). If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org. There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone! \n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/\n\nPlease note that we are a small regional rescue organization. We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

He has learned to sit to be petted and enjoys playing fetch.  Jed is affectionate and loves attention, so much that he bonds quickly and need to be an only dog.  He will be a very loyal dog to his new family and may not appreciate male \u201cout siders\u201d.  Jed is mostly black and tan, with black stenciling on each toe.  Always smiling and happy, Jed makes everyone he meets feel special\n\nSee www.halah.org for more information and photos. Visit us on www.facebook.com/Home.At.Last.Animal.Haven",

I was doing great until February of 2020 when I was diagnosed with cancer, but fortunately think they got it all. I am happy, running all over and do not seem to be deterred by this set back. It is something we will just have to keep an eye on. I would love to spend my golden years in a home of my own. They think I would do best in a quiet adult only home.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Prince Albert is a big young boy who needs a nice big yard or small acreage with secure fencing. He has no trouble climbing over our 5' tall fencing, but so far, our 6' fencing seems to keep him contained. He wants to be close to his people, and will definitely not stay in the pasture as a livestock guardian. BUT, he so far hasn't shown a lot of interest in living inside the house.\n\nWe think perhaps the ideal home for Albert would be a home in the country where he could enjoy life in a big back yard, preferably with another big dog as his companion. He doesn't bark excessively, so he shouldn't annoy your neighbors if he lives outside. Of course, he needs good shelter -- in his foster home, he prefers sleeping in the garage.\n\nAlbert is NOT safe with cats or chickens. He seems to be safe with goats, donkeys, and cattle, but since he lives in the yard and NOT the pasture, we can't say that is an absolute certainty. We will adopt him out only as a pet or guardian of hearth and home, NOT as an LGD.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Prince Albert, please complete an application on our website at www.bluebonnetrescue.org.",

            "description": "Polly is a lovely 10yr old girl that is soft hearted and gentle. On the verge of emaciation, she came into rescue in need of good food and a warm, sudsy bath. She introduced herself to us with a kiss, and has wagged her tail about 90% of the time. \n\nPolly loves other dogs and everyone she meets, but cats not so much. At the previous shelter she was so well behaved with other dogs that they deemed her a very special girl, and we certainly know why...she has a heart of gold! With small dogs, she likes them very much, but she gets excited when she first meets them. It would be best for them to meet and spend a little time together first if there's one in a potential forever home. \n\nOne of our favorite things about Polly is her infectious smile and kind eyes. She has one of the best grins weve ever seen, and shes not afraid to flash it! Her entire face lights up! \n\nAnother darling characteristic is that she sticks by your side in everything you do, always there just to let you know you have a friend supporting you. Quiet, well mannered and just happy to be with you, when you turn around you'll see her gentle eyes gazing at your with admiration.\n\nPolly is on seizure medication and will be for the rest of her life. It's an inexpensive medication that has proven to work well for her. She will require regular bloodwork to monitor her levels (every 6mths). \n\nPolly does get slightly anxious when you leave, only displayed by barking and sometimes jumping on the door. She is non-destructive, however, and is very well mannered indoors. She is allowed to roam free in the house when nobody is home due to these good manners.\n\nPolly must have had someone unkind to her, though, because shes afraid of little things like a brush, topical flea/tick prevention, veterinary work, or anything that you have in your hand that looks like its coming at her. She's made great progress but sometimes she still becomes afraid, so we work around it. Outside of those moments, however, she is affectionate, playful, gives hugs and is never afraid.\n\nWith a kind smile and gentle disposition, Polly is laid back and easy going. She does have some spunk though, for she loves a good walk and a car ride, and OH MY she loves a ball and a stuffed toy! She also loves waffle fries and a soft, cozy dog bed. The most adorable thing though is that whenever a new dog enters her foster home, shes thrilled! She always lets them know they are welcomed and that theyre going to have lots of love and lots of fun. Another one of Polly's favorite things to do is look out the window!\n\nIf youd like an established, kind soul that is deserving of a pampered life, yet loves to get out and go, youll want to meet Polly. If youre interested in doing so, just let us know!",

No matter the outcome, we will email all applicants once the dog has been adopted. Thank you for your understanding.\n\n**\n\nYo! My name is Rudy. I'm a small guy, loyal to the core, roughly 8-9 years old and I love to eat! I also love to cuddle, but I don't like being picked up. so just take a seat, let me jump up to you, and then I'll move in for the cuddles! \n\nI do well with other dogs, but since I still have a bit of spunk, I'll chase cats (FYI - the cats I currently live with tolerate my occasional chase). Small children make me nervous, so I'd prefer a home with adults only. \n\nIn fact, let me be brutally honest with you. I'm a typical Chihuahua. I really need to be with someone who has owned Chihuahuas and understands me and my kind. Lucky Tales has also asked me to tell you that I'm much more fond of men than I am of women, so my ideal home would be one with no chicks, dames, gals, girlies - you get the idea. \n\nSo, who is looking for a small, but devoted companion?! Anyone?\n\n?I know it's a tall order to fill but my foster says the right person is out there for me, we just haven't found them yet, so I guess I'll just keep my paws crossed that it happens soon! Oh! I'm housebroken and crate trained, too. \n\nI'm up to date on shots, neutered, microchipped, and heartworm negative.\n\n?My Adoption Fee is $100.00*",

            "description": "Roger is an 8-9 year old American Pit Bull Terrier who was previously adopted from Wish Bone and because his owner's circumstances changed, he needed to come back. He is searching for his forever home.\n\nRoger is an active and playful dog, who enjoys both walks and car rides. He loves tug-of-war, but is missing a few teeth so it may take him a minute to get a good grip. He is especially fond of treats, and can be persuaded to sit and shake. Roger can be very vocal, sometimes \"speaking\" in the manner of Huskies, Beagles, and certain cats. His strong \"Pit Bull accent\" can be intimidating to visitors. Despite his gruff voice, Roger is very affectionate to humans, and guests should be warned before coming within kissing range. Towels are recommended.\n\nWhile Roger's love of humans is exceptional even by dog standards, he has no tolerance for his own kind. Roger will need to be the only pet in his home, and special precautions must be taken in public. Dog parks, boarding kennels, and any off-leash situations will be unsafe for Roger, and continued training is strongly encouraged. \n\nDue to Roger's strong prey drive, his future home most not include cats, other dogs, or other small animals.\n\nWe likewise suggest a home with no children under the age of 12. Prior to adoption, approved applicants must dedicate time to working with Roger and getting to know him. He loves making new (human) friends, so apply today! Roger will be a FANTASTIC companion for the right person - the one who will understand him and love him unconditionally!\n\nHis minimum adoption fee is $195 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents. \n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

            "description": "This sweet girl and her sister landed in a shelter that does not allow the adoption of Pittie breeds. Unfortunately, they were heartworm positive and were treated in December 2019. DJ needs monthly HW preventative for the next 6 months and retested for HW to be sure she is clear...but that should not stand in the way of this very sweet and silly girl! DJ is used to living with her sister who is bossy! Her sister has been adopted and DJ is waiting for her turn. DJ would like a companion dog that is calm and easy going...people that like to snuggle...and a comfy place to hang out. If you are interested in DJ, please fill out the online application at www.etnpitbullrescue.org or email us at etnpitbullrescue@gmail.comEast TN Pit Bull Rescue adopts out to companion homes only. Adoptions require an application that is verified, a meeting that includes ALL members of the household, a home visit, and a trial period. We do not place our dogs in homes with unaltered pets or homes that have pets but do not have a vet. All of our dogs are placed as inside pets, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, vaccinations current, and HW- or treated within the last 6 months for heart worms by our vet. Adoption fees start at $150 for adults and $200 for pups.

She was in such bad shape that the good samaritan that found her thought she was literally a bag of trash. She was not trash, she was a puppy. She had suffered in ways we can\u2019t imagine. \n\nOpal is a true testament to resiliency, prayer, love and life! She has made a full recovery and life has never been better for Miss Opal, you can see it in her eyes! (Not to mention how strikingly beautiful those bi-color eyes are!). \n\nOpal absolutely LOVES people. She is so kind, loving and playful. Opal is very smart, knows her commands and will indicate when she has to go potty. She LOVES dogs and has been in a foster home with multiple fur siblings. This is the type of environment we wish for Opal as she continues to thrive.\n\nOpal loves to exercise, she loves tennis balls, loves to swim and loves her foster mamma! A fenced yard will be required to adopt Opal, and Opal wants me to tell you that a pool is a big plus ;)\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this beauty queen, please apply at www.twotailzrescue.org!",

This gem has been overlooked so far because he doesn't \"stand out\" physically, and is just a quiet, mellow guy - but his lucky adopter will be glad that others passed up such a fantastic dog!\n\nFig has some allergies which are managed by two medications and is currently on a prescription limited ingredient diet (Science Diet D/D) ; without medication this boy becomes terribly itchy and loses his fur, so it's important that his adopter is prepared to continue his daily meds for life! He is also receiving medicated baths and spray several times a week.\n\nA note from one of our dog volunteers/ #1 fan - \" Figuro is just my idea of perfection. He looks at you with these sweet sweet eyes. He has such a gentleness about him. And the way he checks in with you when on walks... oh, melt my heart, little buddy! \"\n\nFiguro wants to be the only dog in his home. He was recently returned and the family that adopted him loved him but weren't able to successfully integrate him with their other dogs. He is fine with passing dogs and dogs in the neighborhood, but should be the only dog in his forever home.\n\nHe has tested well with cats here at the shelter, but would have to be slowly introduced to a cat in his new home, and we are not sure if he would guard food or toys from a cat like he has previously done with dogs in his prior home.\n\nCome meet him today!\n\n___________\n\nAll adoptions are by appointment only. Please find the animal you like in the Adoptable Pets area of our internal website and then submit a questionnaire to our adoptions team at adoptmcasac@montgomerycountymd.gov Full COVID-19 adoption procedures can be found here: https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/animalservices/adoption/covidadoption.html Website: montgomerycountyMD.gov/animalservices \n\n___________ \n\n**** PLEASE NOTE: Our adoption process can move quite quickly, and applications are considered on a first-come, first-served basis. Some animals, especially puppies/kittens and small dogs, can go very quickly. For this reason, we recommend that if you see an animal you are interested in, you send in an adoption questionnaire as soon as possible. Please do not bring your current pets to the shelter. If you intend to adopt a dog and want the new dog and your current dog to meet, that can be scheduled with the help of your Adoption Counselor. Thank you! ***** Montgomery County residents are required by law to purchase a Montgomery County Pet License for all dogs and cats at the time of adoption. Pet licenses are $12 annually for animals over 1 year and free for animals under 1 year.",

Just do not call him cute, he has the spirit of a Doberman packed into a Min Pin body and wants you to respect his authority. His life work is to keep his home safe. Pirate loves to let you know when someone rings the doorbell, even if the doorbell is on the TV, and even if he is not always the first dog to notice, he is always the most enthusiastic. \nPirate enjoys quick patrols of the yard to see what has changed, and do some sniffing, then it is back in the house to see if the food dishes got magically refilled while he was out, and then do some serious napping. \nPirate loves a routine, and he loves his bed. He will sometimes join you on the couch and nestle near you. He is not a big snuggler but he does like gentle scratches on his chin and ear rubs, as long as he is in the mood. At night he prefers sleeping on the couch and keeping the house safe while you sleep. \n\nPirate is a unique dog with some unique behaviors. He had a stroke when he was younger which left him with some ataxia and vision differences, along with sensory issues, and some anxiety. Touch can be overwhelming, new surfaces take some figuring out, and a lot of sound or activity will really overwhelm him. He does not like being jostled or bumped into, and being picked up is too much for him, we do not suggest it. This means you have to make some accommodations, like transporting him in his carrier, and letting him decide when it is time for affection. \n\nPirate cannot do stairs but can navigate ramps and can jump on the couch like a pro as long as he has solid footing. Pirate does not do well on walks because you can never be sure when he will be overloaded by his environment, so a fenced yard is necessary. \n\nPirate can handle a quiet visitor or two, as long as they respect his rules and boundaries, and he will quickly made friends with people who know that you should ask before you pet, especially if you bring treats.\n\nPirate is house trained but he tends to go on a schedule, and if he needs to go he needs to go. He does his best to use the pee pad if no one is around to let him out but no one is perfect. \n\nPirate lives with other dogs and cats, and is always polite but not looking to play or really interact with them. He likes to be left out of their games, although he is a champion at the Kong Wobbler.\n\n**********************\nDue to Massachusetts State Regulations we are unable to adopt to residents of Massachusetts at this time.

But once he trusts you, he\u2019s very sweet and snuggly. No kids for George. He likes to run, walk, hike, swim and is an all around great adventure buddy. He would do best with a fenced in yard and it is a requirement to adopt him; the more time he spends outside, the happier he is. He knows his basic commands and walks well on leash!\n\nPLEASE DO NOT INQUIRE ABOUT GEORGE IF:\n-ANYONE under 18 lives in your home\n-You have roommates\n-You are against crates\n-You are not open to balanced training\n-You do not have a fenced in yard\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: All dogs are in foster care all over MA & RI. They are NOT at the cat shelter, which is the address listed on Petfinder. There are ONLY cats there. We do not set up meet and greets with dogs until after you've been approved to adopt.

We rescued Gertie from a shelter where it seems that she had given birth sometime in the recent past, although she did not have any puppies with her.  She was very sad and wanted out of the shelter, we can\u2019t blame her.  At first, Gertie thought she needed to be defensive with other dogs, we think she was accustomed to protecting herself in her past life, since she wasn\u2019t spayed, it\u2019s possible all of the boys were after her.  After a few days Gertie settled in and seemed less fearful around new dogs.  When meeting new dogs in new situations she can be standoff-ish, but once she sees a dog is not a threat, she\u2019s all about making friends and wags her tail.\n\nGertie has been living in foster care with 2 medium dogs and is doing great.  She can sometimes be jealous as she thinks she should get the number one spot in the line for attention, she\u2019s probably never had attention before and she\u2019s really soaking it up now. Gertie LOVES taking car rides and sits calmly and is quiet. She loves toys now and loves playing with her foster friends outside on nice days. She has a very silly side that we love and makes us laugh.  While her foster mom is at work, Gertie stays in a crate.  She does fine in the crate but is excited for freedom in the evenings.\n\nGertie is a pleasant and happy dog, .  She would also enjoy some evening walks. \n\nGreta did get adopted to a wonderful woman unfortunately she had major surgery and is incapable of walking now so no longer can care for her. Sad since Greta thought she had a forever home that was almost ,2 yrs ago. \n\nwww.tinypawsrescue.com for an application\nThank you for choosing to adopt",

He prefers no young children since he is large and is not a huge fan of other dogs. He's about 5-6 years old.\n\nFor more info please email dogs@illinoisvalleyanimalrescue.net  or fill out the adoption application found at www.illinoisvalleyanimalrescue.net.  The application does not commit you to adopting, just helps us find the dog that is the right fit for your family. We do not have open adoption hours due to COVID-19 so an application must be submitted and approved before we set up an appointment for you to meet any of our dogs! It can take up to a week for the Adoption Board to review applications and upon approval will contact you.\n\nOur adoption fees are $250 ($125 for seniors over 8) and include their spay/neuter, bordetella vaccine, parvo/distemper & rabies shot, as well as heart worm testing and micro chipping.",

I cannot have any visitors before April 6th. You will need to fill out an online application and receive a phone call back from a staff member that everything is ok with the application prior April 6th. All family members and any dogs from the household need to be present at the time of the adoption. \n\nWe open at 9 am Saturday mornings and we will be helping adoptions in the order of when they submitted an approved application to us. There will be a sign in sheet on the front door at 8:30 am so that we can pull applications for the people that arrive between 8:30-9 am. Again, the order in which adoptions will come in to the shelter to see any adoptable dogs or cats first thing on Saturday mornings will be as to when the application was submitted to Animal House Shelter so there is no need to come to the shelter any earlier than 8:30 to sign in. This will be the procedure for people that arrive between 8:30-9 am.\n\nAfter 9 am, on Saturday mornings it will be first come, first serve after we help all of the adoptions that signed in between 8:30-9 am. Most people submit general applications to us which do not specify a name or a particular litter they are interested in so there is no way for us to know until people arrive Saturday morning at 8:30 how many people are interested in a particular litter, puppy, kitten, cat or adult dog. We always have around 300 dogs & cats available for adoption and the adoption counselors will help you to find the right companion for your family!\n\nPlease fill out an online application and we will give you a call as soon as we receive it. Visit our \u2018Adopt\u2019 page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our \u2018Visit\u2019 page for hours and directions to our shelter. We look forward to seeing you soon!\n\nLink to the Adoption Application: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-aplication/\n\nOur website is always kept 100% up to date with who is currently available. All new animals (40/week) are added to the site 2 weeks before their availability date to give you time to fill out your adoption application and get the family ready to come out to the shelter that day. As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. Keep any eye on our website for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt.  The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family.  We do go in order of when you submitted your application with us.  So it is always best that you get your general application for any animal in with us as soon as possible.\n\nAnimal House Shelter\n13005 Ernesti Road \nHuntley IL, 60142\n\n847-961-5541 phone \n847-961-5537 fax\n\nOpen:\n\nSunday-Friday from 11 AM to 7 PM\nSaturday from 9 AM to 7 PM \n\nConnect With Us:\n\nLike Us On Facebook !\nWatch Us On YouTube !\nFollow Us On Twitter ! \n\nAdoption Application: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAdopt a Pet: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/\n\nDirections to Shelter: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/visit/\n\nAdoptable Dogs: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/dogs/\n\nAdoptable Cats: https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/cats/\n",

            "description": "Sasha-******TLC Club Member******* 7 year old pitbull terrier, not good with cats, no kids, potty trained. Sasha is an active Pitty girl who was adopted out and returned due to a change in circumstances. Sasha has moderate to high energy but also will be happy snuggling on the couch for some of the day. Sasha would do best in a home with pitbull experience And in a home with no kids as she can get over excited by too much stimulation. Sasha can live with other dogs though we recommend dogs who are calmer and will tolerate her poor play manners well and who will not overstimulate her. Sasha gets spring allergies that cause her to have red eyes and itchy skin. This has been treated by providing her with Allergy pills when the allergies come on and are resolved when the seasons change. Sasha would do well in a home with no cats and in a home with someone who has experience setting boundaries and limitations. And a home with a fenced yard is a must.Please note we do not have a central kennel facility, all of our pets are located in foster homes. The first step in meeting one of our furry friends is to fill out an application on our website at <a href=''www.rainbowrescues.org''>www.rainbowrescues.org</a>. A volunteer will be in contact with you in 1-2 business days to review your application and speak with you about the adoption process. Our adoption fees at this time are $250 for Adult dogs, $300 for puppies (6 months and under), $100 for senior dogs, $100 for cats, and a $50 fee for small animals. **Please be aware that we are not responsible for inaccurate information on some cross-posted sites such as inaccurate adoption fees and inaccurate pet info.**",

She is a Heinz 57, a bit of Carolina dog, Pitbull and Canaan!\n Karma loves adventures and rides well in a car. She isn't much of a couch potato.so definitely needs an active person and/or dogs to hang out with. She is people friendly(children are an unknown) and working on sit, stay and heeling on a leash. She does well with male dogs and calmer female dogs as companions. We think her perfect dog companion would be a female dog who is her size and temperament. \nNo cats. in her pack, she says only canines allowed!\nWe see her with a active lifestyle, perfect for a running enthusiast, an outdoorsy person headed for camping, a day at the lake or beach playing fetch! She is looking for her forever home, could it be you?  \n\nTo get more information on Karma please send an inquiry through Petfinder or submit a adoption application at goliadpetadoption.net.  Karma was originally adopted from an animal control facility in southeast Texas but was given to an unidentified family in Goliad County where she was abandoned either before or after Hurricane Harvey.

If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nI'm GIMLI!  I was turned into the shelter by a kind man who found me huddled in the hay in his barn after he tried to find my owners.  I was cold and scared and miserable....... until I landed at Utah's Perfect Pointers.  The Big Dogs there take very good care of me and I'm learning to be a teenager and run around playing.  I particularly love having other dogs and a couple of cat to sleep with.  I'll even crawl into an open crate to snuggle with one of the older dogs.  They were getting a little tired of the cone I had to wear when I was neutered, though.\n\nI'm just starting on my steep learning curve.  It's totally fun!  I love my ball.  I can play with it for hours.  Chew toys are great.  Other dogs are my bff's.  Every once in awhile I get a little rowdy and the Big Cat smacks me, which calms me down very quickly.\n\nI need at least one other dog in my new home and a family that is committed to helping me become the spectacular dog I know I can be.\n\n----------\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above. If you are interested in adopting a GSP please contact the closest groups below. Keep in mind that not all of their dogs may be listed on their sites.\n\nGreat Plains Pointer Rescue (Nebraska, Iowa & Minnesota)\ngreatplains@cox.net\nCerbinco@gmail.com\nMinnesota - gpprmnmgr@gmail.com\n\nIllinois Shorthair Rescue (Michigan & Indiana)\nilgsprescue@aol.com or ziechfam@yahoo.com\n\nMAK Rescue - MO, AR, KS\nargsprescue@rocketmail.com\n\nGSP Rescue New England (MA, RI, CT, VT, NH and the Albany area of NY)\nclong@gsprescuene.org or mmorris@gsprescuene.org\n\nGSP Rescue of NJ - gsprescuenj@hotmail.com\n\nOhio Shorthair Rescue - Ohio, Indiana and northern Kentucky\ncheryl@ohioshorthairrescue.org\n\nOklahoma GSP Rescue okgspr@gmail.com admin@okgsp.org\n\nSoutheast German Shorthaired Pointer Rescue (NC, SC, GA, FL, TN, MS, AL)\nGA Coordinator Pojos@comcast.net\nNC and SC Coordinator, ktscott1302@gmail.com\nAL & MS Coordinator alabamagspresq@gmail.com\nTN Coordinator lacompton71@gmail.com\n\nTexas GSP Rescue amber@texasgsp.org\n\nIf you are in Northern California you need to go through your local group first and allow them 4-6 months to find your new best friend before working with other GSP rescue groups. margue@norcalgsprescue.org",

            "description": "I'm little Noel!  I'm the happiest, busiest little girl you'll meet.  I've had a lot of experiences since I was born on January 4, 2019.  My story is below.\n\n----\n\nLittle Noel\u2019s had a pretty eventful life for being only 8 months old!  Noel has IMHA \u2013 immune mediated hemologic anemia. This means her body\u2019s immune system is destroying her red blood cells and platelets.  We\u2019re not sure how this occurred. Her sisters, Snickers (now \u201cCedar\u201d) and KitKat (now \u201cMayce\u201d) are fine.\n\nThe job of red blood cells in the body is to carry oxygen. When red cells are decreased, less oxygen is available to the cells of the body and the dog becomes weak, has labored breathing, darkened urine, bruises easily and can bleed into vital organs such as the brain or spinal cord. Causes of the condition are varied and include: vaccinations, antibiotics, cancer, genetic factors, bacterial/viral infections, toxins, and radiation. But in most cases no obvious factor is determined.\n\nFortunately on May 27 Noel\u2019s foster mom, Marie, noticed that her gums were very white. We called on Dr. Kay who met us immediately and told us to get her into emergency care. Yes\u2026 on Memorial Day. We took her to Blue Pearl Veterinary Hospital where she was seen by Dr. Campbell who diagnosed her condition, gave her a transfusion and kept her overnight. We weren\u2019t sure she was going to live through the night. A bone marrow aspirate indicated that she wasn\u2019t producing any new red blood cells at all. \n\nGradually Noel\u2019s red blood cell counts started to improve and she became a boisterous, romping puppy again. Blood draws were only done once a month as we very slowly decreased her azathioprine and prednisone, added plavex to her regimen and her red blood cells started to function at almost normal levels.\n\nNoel is at Casa UPP tormenting the adult dogs. Fortunately the older dogs will play and run with her in the yard. Noel is ball obsessed. And she wants you (i.e., \u201cme\u201d) to spend my life throwing it for her to retrieve. I try and toss it in varied directions to keep her on the hunt as long as possible but she\u2019s insatiable and will search for the darn thing until she finds (and returns) it. She loves tossing it in \u201cdifficult to recover\u201d places \u2013 the pool, the window well, the water bucket, the kitchen sink and the toilet (if I\u2019m not quick at closing the lid). The latter is my least favorite.\n\nNoel's complete story is posted on our facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/pg/UtahsPerfectPointers/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2660291533989169&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCzsdYCf0k-V0bHh_1kmIjVTIfYRHiXnfZ3fME9TmuKcrCPuw9sd49-2-q2CSjI98D_U6-gQTdi0RBkp1lIBLxbPV2PfL3Zk9FgwjGQzPTK9CM-dNkgkc2p3nYNln4UjnkAVKFtvYFYPf_EWbm590PF72WokCnEu3CZOWvyPDCofgn9WNGdQFJRwQ2y-5JSylhm0EpBFcNMOBGAKg4TkLDSC3h4B7bXfthxq1sYLC-RUkPgh9VhEfzu89OOvVakp9fwkqun9myVcAU9xJqxP9xFFWR5veVn4ytN3JEFkCU2G_ds-q4f6oUJ3IBKVONfHMH_hS7K_bz0lhDvv3xg7SZ4mMQ6BL3V6knEAb__OTLUFKfSq1crG9GGO-mtyNZy-BTKbaXHwLuzQS-5Vg1TDwpaLkpRyPegICwdzh9kyhe8zos8TsU2VcO19f05BjibpQgj9-8VyP3FzTL8TK6H&__tn__=-UC-R\n\nWe also have a facebook fundraiser for her:  https://www.facebook.com/donate/471351523453723/\n\nDonations for her care are gratefully accepted at:\n- our regular mail address: Utah's Perfect Pointers PO Box 17971, Salt Lake City 84117\n- our paypal account paypal.com/us/fundraiser/charity/1362816\n\n\n\n----------\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above.

She was extremely afraid and confused when she first came and had to be on a 25 ft leash in the yard and walked at all times. Now she is on a 6 ft leash ( on her own) and will respond to our hand signals to return to us to go inside. She knows to sit and lay down. She is friendly with the dogs as she passes their kennels- but the problem is she doesn't hear them give her warning growls, or barks, making yard play difficult. She is also a bulldozer and would be dangerous for small children. She is not aggressive and would not intentionally hurt anyone, but unintentionally is the problem.\nShe has come a long way and we will continue to work with her and build on all of the headway she has made so far.",

Here's what his foster dad has this to say:\nFor the most part, Bentley is house trained. He's had some accidents but he will bark, howl and paw at you when he needs to go out. He loves his walks and does good in the car. He doesn't bark except when he needs to go out. He doesn't beg for food and hasn't torn up anything in the house. Bentley does not need to be crated, but he is fine in his crate. Essentially, Bentley sleeps, goes for walks, sits in his foster dad's lap and plays with his Kong. He has guarding issues, so no stuffed animals or balls. He does not guard his Kong or other toys that have treats associated with them.\n\nBecause of his guarding issues, Bentley needs a home with no children and an experienced owner committed to training and working with him. He originally came to us from California so much of his background is unknown.\n\nPlease contact our shelter to learn more at 410.268.4388.",

I was severely abused early in life and trust is very hard for me with humans but I'm learning not all people are bad. I still need a couple medical issues to work on before I'm fully ready for my forever home but I'm getting there. Please be patient with me.\n\nIf you are interested in Moose, please visit our website:  www.ilenglishbulldogrescue.org, and read through our adoption criteria to see if you meet our requirements.

Sadie stays indoors most of the time, with a dog door to go outside and has recently been up to her old tricks, of climbing the chain link fence, to \u201cgo for a run,\u201d with no concern for traffic or where she ends up. Owner had to make a difficult decision to put safety of dogs above their love and companionship.   Needs lots of lovin!  Would love it if Sadie could be adopted with her best buddy Sage, but not a requirement.\n\nTexas Great Pyrenees Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to Great Pyrenees. We have the best selection of Pyrs in Texas and we do home checks and vet checks before placement. We start with adoption applications (no cost/obligation) and we make placements on a first submitted-first approved basis.

He does well with other dogs but unsure of cats. Pancho is skittish and needs an experienced foster or adoptive family to continue to work with him. He is making progress quickly. He\u2019s a gorgeous dog and once he\u2019s comfortable in his home he is a lot of fun. He is extremely smart. He will not be suitable for a working dog situation. Please do not inquire if this is your intention. Please contact savapetwac@yahoo.com or 7133852317 for additional information.

            "description": "Well, mama always said there's a lid for every pot, and I'm sure hopin' she was right!  The truth is I'm not perfect! I have a few flaws...and I'm comin' to you hat in hand, hopin' and prayin' that you can see your way to lovin' me despite my quirks and imperfections. To be honest (and I promised I would be!) I don't like men. I don't like cats (except to chase!) and if that's not enough, I'm a barker...yup! there it is out in the open! No guys, no cats, no condos, no apartments.  And I need slow intros to other dogs, so I guess I better say no dog parks. \nPhew! I feel better with that out in the open. Now on the plus side, I'm funny, quirky, and once I get to know you (and assuming you're the right gender!) I am as sweet and loving as a girl could be, you'll be watchin' tv and my head will be snuggled right up on your lap. And not to boast but I've done great things with my training! I walk really well on a leash, I heel politely and I park my bum down as soon as you say Sit! My training has helped me with new situations that previously scared me, so I've made great progress. I love all kids, including boys!\nMy trainer will consult with you to ensure that I'm the right fit for your family.\n\nName: Coffee\nWeight: 30 lbs.\nAge: 2.75 years\nGender: female \nBreed: lab mix \nColour: black \n\nGood with adults: Good with women, not good with men\nGood with kids: yes, loves kids\nGood with other dogs: no\nGood with cats: absolutely no cats\nHouse trained: yes\nCrate trained: yes, goes in when told\nEnergy level: medium \nCan be handled/touched: yes \nBarker: Yes - no condos or apartments\nFlight Risk: she will walk in between your legs and will go out the door with you.  Better to be safe and keep a eye on her with open doors.   \nFood aggressive: no \nWalks on a leash: yes, has been in training and has her basic obedience down. \nRides well in a car:  yes \nDestructive: no\nNeeds a home with a yard: daily walks and potty breaks will be ok \nNeeds a home with another dog: no, she should be the only dog\nCan live in an apartment environment: no\n. \nFoster update:\nCoffee is one of a kind. She is loyal, a great snuggler, always by your side, and smart! Her idea of a perfect night? Cuddled up on the couch, head on your lap. She is crate trained (will go in for treats- but much prefers to be with you!) She is not food aggressive, and can be easily trained with treats! Coffee's previous history is unknown and she is wary of everyone she meets, especially men, but once she warms up to you- she will be your best friend. Once she knows you're her forever mama, she will be extremely loyal to you and only you!  \nShe needs slow introductions to other dogs but has been fine in her foster home with other dogs around. Coffee has been in a training program and now has her basics down. She walks well on a leash, heels politely and knows how to sit. Coffee loves snuggles but does need slow introductions to new people. With her training that she has done, she is doing much better with new situations that were previously scary to her. Coffee comes with a trainer consult for potential applicants to ensure she is the right fit for your family. \n\nPLEASE READ ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE DOG'S PROFILE, AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE, niagaradogrescue.com , BEFORE EMAILING US WITH QUESTIONS. OUR VOLUNTEERS USE UP VALUABLE TIME ANSWERING QUESTIONS WHERE THE ANSWERS ARE READILY AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE. \nSINCE WE ARE ENTIRELY VOLUNTEER RUN AND RECEIVE A HIGH VOLUME OF APPLICATIONS, IT MAY TAKE AT LEAST 2-3 WEEKS BEFORE AN ADOPTION TEAM MEMBER CAN RESPOND TO YOUR APPLICATION.

Ilyis great with everyone and thing, she loves going on walks and hanging out in her peoples laps. If Ily could choose what to do she would chose to be in her peoples laps no matter what they were doing.  Ily needs an active home with other dogs and kids as that is her environment with her foster and taking her away from that we feel would put her into a depression.\n\nIly is an owner surrender but by no fault of her own.\n\nWe hold an event every weekend at our facility on SATURDAY 11-5pm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please visit our social media platforms for the specifics for each weekend as it changes from week to week.

Quick movements frighten her, and she'd do best in a home where she has peaceful but abundant attention. Sadie is not recommended for families with children under the age of 15.\n\nAnimal Rescue Recon makes sure that each dog is current on its vaccinations, has been or will be spayed or neutered, and is microchipped to help keep pets out of the shelters and get them back home where they belong. For more information or to schedule an appointment contact Animal Rescue Recon (925) 392-7654\n\n-----\nPlease tell us a bit about yourself/family\n\u2022  What city do you live in?\n\u2022  Do you rent or own?\n\u2022  Any children in the home?  What ages? List all family members living in home\n\u2022  What is your work schedule?  Family schedule?\n\u2022  How many hours per day would pet be left alone? \n\u2022  Where is pet kept when left alone? \n\u2022  Where does pet sleep?\n\u2022  Any other pets in the home?  If so, what type?\n\u2022  Provide detailed pictures or video of your fenced yard - entire perimeter including gates and the bottom of the fencing.  Yard must be free of foxtails and fully secured.\n\u2022  Home check may be performed\n\u2022  If \"meet & greet\" is scheduled, all household members, dogs included, must be present\n\nMost of our available dogs can be seen at Pet Food Express in Antioch on Saturdays from 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nOur adoption fee is $300 for Dogs and $350 for puppies (under 6 months).

Perry adores his toys, he will toss them up in the air and catch them. He is still young, barely a year old, so he is still working on his manners. Perry is very intelligent and will be a breeze to train. He would do well any household. Perry loves everyone big and small. He also does great with other dogs with proper introduction. Perry would do best in a cat free home or with a cat that is used to dogs and would not run. Perry is fully vetted, heartworm negative, on prevention and microchipped.",

            "description": "ECHO is a handsome, energetic, 4-year-old Border Collie mix with an excellent resume!\n\nHe's a hard worker, or at least he would be if he had a job to do!  Border Collie's are working dogs and ECHO is a quintessential Border.  He wants a job!  He's always looking for something productive to do so he would be happiest as part of a family who keeps a small flock of pet sheep in their backyard.  Failing that, he would really like to be with a person or family who enjoys an active lifestyle.\n\nIf you are into camping, hiking, playing frisbee, running or perhaps interested or involved in canine agility games and competitions, ECHO is your man!\n\nECHO is very clever, most Borders are, so he needs mental stimulation as well as physical challenges. The more enrichments you can provide the happier he'll be.\n\nThey only flaw he's got, and it's not a big one, is that he doesn't like to share his food.  He's protective of his bowl when he's eating.  So he should be fed separately from other dogs and just allowed to eat his meal, undisturbed.  This behavior can either be accommodated as described, or addressed with training.\n\nABOUT THE BORDER COLLIE\n\nAffectionate, Smart, Energetic\n\nBorders are athletic, medium-sized herders standing 18 to 22 inches at the shoulder. The overall look is that of a muscular but nimble worker unspoiled by passing fads. Both the rough coat and the smooth coat come in a variety of colors and patterns.\n\nThe almond eyes are the focus of an intelligent expression\u2014an intense gaze, the Border\u2019s famous \u201cherding eye\u201d, is a breed hallmark. On the move, Borders are among the canine kingdom\u2019s most agile, balanced, and durable citizens.\n\nThe intelligence, athleticism, and trainability of Borders have a perfect outlet in agility training. Having a job to perform, like agility\u2014or herding or obedience work\u2014is key to Border happiness. Amiable among friends, they may be reserved with strangers.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nWell, you can foster, foster-to-adopt, (in case you're not sure) or adopt ECHO.\n\nTo get the ball rolling, just fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION, which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption.  This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives. \n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details. \n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

She gave birth the very next day to 10 puppies and to make matters worse, she was extremely protective of the pups. Unfortunately, between Rubia's terrible condition, the lack of milk production, and the shelter environment, 8 of the 10 pups passed away. Rubia then lashed out and bit a kennel worker that was cleaning her run. Rubia and her 2 remaining pups were extremely sick and we were lucky enough to have a foster step up for their tiny family. After being seen by our vet, we had to pull the surviving pups from Rubia in order to bottle feed them as there was no way they would have survived if we didn't. Rubia has an advanced case of heartworm disease and her chest was filled with fluid. It will be a long road to recovery for Rubia and her babies. Sadly, neither of Rubia's two remaining pups pulled through.\nABOUT RUBIA\nRubia is happy to be out of the county shelter and is still a little skeptical of new people, but she is not lashing out at anyone. Now that she is away from her pups and she is having good human experiences, Rubia is actually quite happy and accepting of new people. She is full of tail wags and love. The fluid swelling up in her chest has gone down completely and Rubia's true personality is coming out even more. Rubia is cautious with strangers, but quickly learns to trust. She is in heart failure, but her heartworms have been treated and she is doing extremely well. Dogs can lives for years with bad hearts and she's on medication to help. Rubia is crate trained and housebroken (she's never had an accident). She's a happy girl and is very loving and grateful to be out of the pound. She's an expert at dramatically throwing herself on the floor for belly rubs! She appears to be good with other dogs and kisses the dogs through their crates. Rubia needs a foster or an adopter to complete her rescue journey.\nPhoto Album of Rubia: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2694788110579338\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

To view P.D. please visit Petfinder page, his direct link is: https://www.petfinder.com/dog/p-dot-d-42964108/nc/bryson-city/paws-animal-shelter-nc233/\n\n\nMoonshine started his PAWS journey by being found in the median of the highway after being hit by a car this poor pooch was left for dead until PAWS got the call that he needed help. We were able to help get this sweet boy to the vet but unfortunately his leg could not be saved. Moonshine has not let his amputated leg keep him down. He has kept high spirits a testament to his good nature and kind heart. Moonshine is truly a friend to all and has made pals with both dogs and cats while in foster. He is still currently in foster so if you wish to learn more on how to meet Moonshine please call the shelter at 828-488-0418.",

When he looks at you with those deep gold eyes, you have no choice but to swoon in love. Extremely communicative, smart, playful guy. Looking for an experienced shepherd home to understand his language. Walks nicely on leash, loves to play fetch, and playfully banter with his people.\n\n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

PICCOLO is a little particular with other dogs and can be bossy, so he might do best alone :)  \n\nProject dogs are very scared of strangers.  These dogs will not go to strangers, they will run into a corner or under something to get away.  They know us and we can pick all of them up, but we do not know if they will bite a stranger.  Some will just run away.  Most of them are our older dogs.  Although, we do have some younger ones.  The older dogs are also in need of a dental and rabies.  These dogs have been with us from 6-10 years now. These dogs do not leave our fenced area.  Nothing goes in and nothing goes out.  They are welcome to live their lives out with us where they are comfortable.  However, I think that some could learn to live in a home.  They need time and patience.\n\nIf you are serious about adopting one of these dog(s) you must be willing to commit to visiting every day for approximately 2 weeks.  We have done this with several of our dog(s) and it works.  When they go to your home they are familiar with you.  In a matter or several days or even hours they trust and feel safe with you.\n  \nIf you cannot commit to the time needed please do not waste your time or mine.  This is the only way you can adopt a project dog.\n\nIf you would like to meet one of the project dog(s), please go to our website, kritterkamprescue.com and fill out the adoption application. It only takes a few minutes to do. Then, if approved, you may call or email for an appointment.  This is usually all very quick and easy. However, if you have any difficulty or don't receive a reply within 24 hours, please call us @ 916-691-1364.\n\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Personality:\nZiva came to us from a hoarding case in TN and is adjusting to being in a loving home and learning what love and affection are. She is settling in well but will need continued love and guidance in her adoptive home. More information will come as Ziva settles into her foster home.\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com. To fill out an application, please visit\n\nhttp://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption\n.",

I had a very bad wound around my neck, possibly from a rope. The rest of my skin was also in bad condition. The nice people at Natchitoches Hope for Paws took me in and helped me heal! It wasn't long before my personality began to show. I am full of life and joy! I will devour you with kisses until you come down to my level. Then I will try to climb you like a mountain and sit on you! I must be part Lap-Dog. I also looove to play! I play well with my best dog buddy here. I do love going on a good leash walk, and my favorite thing ever is the pool! I love the water! If you have a nice fenced-in yard where I can play, I would love to come home with you today!\n\nA generous sponsor has offered to pay for Cadence's adoption in order to help her get adopted! Cadence has been with us at NHFP for almost 4 years, waiting on a loving and forever home. If you have a fenced yard and vet reference and are interested in giving her a loving home, please email natchitocheshopeforpaws@yahoo.com.",

The lady who brought us there said she just found us that way... Whatever the truth of it was, we were finally in a safe place! The vet helped us get healthy but couldn't keep us. They contacted Natchitoches Hope for Paws who took us in. My siblings have since been adopted! I am so happy for them. I am still here, waiting to go to my forever home. I am the sweetest boy! I love to let you kiss my head and pet me once I get to know you. I am a bit skittish though, and I do find new people scary sometimes. Once I get to know you though, I will melt your heart when I look into your eyes and wag my tail with appreciation. I love to be let out to run and play with my dog friends here! But I don't like to walk on the leash. I would do best in a house with loving people and another dog to play with!",

She is house trained too. She walks well on a leash and does well on outings. If that isn't your scene though she is good hanging out at home with you. She gets along with other dogs and kids as well. \n\nTessa spent most of her life before coming to us by roaming around neighborhoods and she has had many litters of puppies from what we understand. But life has changed for her now as she has gotten the medical care she needs and is being fostered. If you are interested in adding a loyal, calm, sweet girl to your pack, may we suggest Tessa?",

When the NPSO arrived to humanely catch that dog, they caught me too! Boy was I a cute surprise! I am a very shy boy. I do well outside and do well with other dogs.I will need a patient owner to take me home; I am not yet comfortable with most humans. I would love a good dog friend to play with though! I would be very low-maintenance for you; all I need is a nice dog house to hide in when I want to feel safe. Please give me the chance to warm up to you at my new furever home.",

I was clearly unsettled, because I took myself all the way to Robeline before staying put! I decided to camp out at a house on the highway. The people at the house didn't have a fenced in yard, and they were worried about my safety being near the highway. After all this time, no owner came forward to claim me. NHFP took me in during April of 2015! I was very full of heartworms and became very sick during treatment; I almost died. But, I am Hank the Tank after all, and I made a full recovery with their assistance, love, and care. I am a beautiful boy and will melt your heart when you look into my gorgeous eyes. I am a great companion and love to be petted. I like to play with some dogs very well. My favorite thing is a good, sturdy chew toy! I love to get my chomp on. I also love a good walk on a leash! But I am a big boy and do pull, so wear good shoes. I would make you a great companion!",

I'm  around  2 years old with enough puppy left to be cute and playful but old enough to settle in for a nice nap and some regular quiet time too.  \n\nI am extremely smart but can get anxious in overly loud or busy situations so I would do best with a large yard, a more quiet family, and someone who has worked with dogs of my size. I love to please and do well with clear direction and like to show off my commands which include sit, down, and stay. I like other dogs and have even made buddies at doggy daycare! \n\nSince I am a big boy, I need a safe backyard with at least a 6 ft. fence as I love spending time chasing squirrels out of my yard!\n\nYounger children make me unsure so I would prefer a home with children 15 and older.\n\nWe are a RESCUE GROUP, not a shelter, and all of our animals are in foster homes. To start the adoption process, email us at adoptions@earstexas.org requesting an application. Submitting an application does not commit you in any way, but helps us make the best match between people and our available dogs. Your current or past dogs must be inside dogs who have been spayed/neutered and are on heartworm prevention. All of the dogs in our program are inside dogs and are completely vetted including all vaccinations, spayed/neutered, free of internal parasites, microchipped, heartworm negative and on prevention before adoption. Our adoption process includes an application, check of vet records or personal references, interview, neutral site meet & greet with the dog and your family, and a home visit.",

While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.NOTE- A PHYSICAL PRIVACY FENCE IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT LEIFLeif is full of life and ready to go out into the great big world and find his forever family. We have a detailed report for you from his foster:\nLeif is fully house trained. Commands he knows:\nsit, come, his name, lay down but you have to use a command. We lower our fist to the floor; sometimes we have a treat in our hand and sometimes we don't.\nWe say 'off' if he jumps up on something and if he tries to jump on us we turn away and say 'off'.\nAs for 'Stay' he will stay if he can still see you.\nHe knows 'drop it' and 'leave it' but if it's a leaf or mulch, sometimes those don't work as they seem to be a favorite snack of his.\n\nHe will need to be an only dog in his forever home. He has not gotten along with any other dogs at training and adopter will need to be in an environment where he will not have to come into contact with other dogs. No dog parks and he could be reactive when walking if he sees another dog.Leif requires a privacy fenced yard so he is not reactive to neighbor dogs.Leif needs to be in a home with adults only.Leif is ready and waiting to be YOUR very own good boy.\nIf you are interested in Leif, please contact:\nrorrcanine@gmail.com\n*** Click here to sponsor this dog! ***",

            "description": "DOB: 2/2018 Weight: 50 lbs\nBy the looks of his past exterior, we fear that Jax's past life wasn't a pleasant one, but we vow to find him the good life he deserves. He's very sweet and does really well with kids but is not fond of other dogs. He will chase cats but doesn't hurt them. He has medium energy and walks well on leash. Unfortunately, Jax has allergies so he requires monthly Cytopoint injections, and needs to take Apoquel every day. Jax will brighten your world with all the love he has to give! Just take a look at his soulful eyes and you will fall in love like we have!\nHe is up to date on shots, neutered, microchipped and heartworm tested negative. He came to the shelter 3/2019.\n***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS? CONTACT pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com\nOur adoption fee is $150 which covers a portion of the dog's vetting costs. The adoption process includes the completion of an application followed by an interview.\nClick here to submit an adoption application: https://pcpoundpuppies.webs.com/adoption-application\n***IMPORTANT: Due to the effects of COVID-19, our Sunday adoption events at Pet Food Center have been canceled until further notice. If there is a dog you are interested in meeting, be sure to contact us and we may be able to set up a meet and greet as soon as possible.***\nYou can get in touch with us by email at pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com or by phone at 812-483-4341 for more information.\nWe respond to inquiries and adoption applications at our earliest opportunity, but please be patient with us as we work full-time jobs and perform this service as volunteers. We do our best to return messages and schedule adoption interviews within a couple of days of receiving your application.\nThe fastest way to get the ball rolling is to complete an adoption application for the dog that caught your eye. Thank you for considering the adoption of a shelter dog!",

            "description": "Scooter is an one and a half year. old shepherd mix.   He was found wandering on a country road with his friend.  A dog lover picked him up and MLD took him into our program.   Scooter is super friendly & loves to play.   He is super adorable and enjoys playing with sticks and chasing his doggie friends.     He is a happy-go-lucky pup and can't wait to find a forever family of his very own.      Scooter is HW+ and has already started his slow-kill protocols.  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies. All of our pets have either tested heart worm negative OR are currently being treated with the slow kill method approved by our veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention.\n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority but not all of our pets require a fenced yard.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and Good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport a puppy under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees at a low $150, but any additional donations are appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meeting for any of fur-babies. Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events. They are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails.\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped.\n",

            "description": "4 SIGNS THAT YOU'RE READY TO FOSTER A DOG!\n*You want to help transform a shelter dog into a pet, and help another family find the right dog for their home.\n*You\u2019ve been thinking about getting a dog but you\u2019re not sure you\u2019re ready for the lifelong emotional and financial commitment, and you want to get some practice while helping dogs in need.\n*You want to give your current dog some canine companionship.\n*You have space in your home and schedule to accommodate a temporary guest and give her the attention she needs.\nIf you nodded in understanding at more than one of the above reasons, you might be ready to foster!\n\nWHAT KINDS OF DOGS GET FOSTERED?\nRescues pull dogs and puppies from shelters who are too stressed out by the shelter environment or need more individual attention than the shelter can provide (including puppies who are too young to be adopted). Shelters have only so much space! Fostering a shelter dog makes space for another,\n\nThe most common reasons foster homes are needed are:\n\n*The shelter is overcrowded, and placing dogs in foster care frees up space to save more dogs.\n*The rescue group wants to learn more about a dog\u2019s personality and behavior in a home setting.\n*A young, energetic dog needs to learn some basic manners before being made available for adoption.\n*A shy or timid dog needs a safe place to come out of her shell.\n*A dog is recovering from illness or injury.\n*A senior or sick dog needs loving hospice care.\n\nTHE MAIN FUNCTION OF A FOSTER HOME IS:\nto provide a safe, loving home environment. For the most part, this entails caring for your foster as you would care for your own dog: offering food, affection, socialization, and exercise to keep the dog happy and healthy.\n\nAs a doggy foster parent, you may also be asked to:\n\n*Transport the dog to and from adoption events.\n*Participate in obedience training at home and/or in classes.\n*Report back to the rescue with information about the dog\u2019s personality and behavior.\n*Speak with potential adopters to tell them about your foster dog and help determine if they are a good match.\n\nFOSTERING SAVES LIVES!\nPLEASE CALL/TEXT PAWS RESCUE 727-772-3935\n\nPaws foster program PROVIDES:\nFOOD~quality dogfood, food bowls\nVETTING~surgery, vaccinations, microchips\nFLEA/TICK/HEARTWORM MONTHLY PREVENTATIVES\nCOLLAR/LEASH\nCRATE (if needed)\nWE ADVERTISE AND PRESCREEN ALL ADOPTERS\nCALL or TEXT 727-772-3935 ASAP PLEASE HELP!!",

She is 3 years old very loving. but needs a lot of training.  She is so good natured that once she has learned leash manners, and loses her puppy mouthy behavior she will be a great pet.  If you are looking for an active companion, Mercedes would be a great fit. She is a little too focused on small animals when she walks, and while she gets along with some dogs, there are others that she is not comfortable around.  She plays so hard, that we think she would be best in a home without small children.\n\nFollow this link to our online application\nhttps://rawhiderescue.org/?page_id=13\n\n\nTHIS IS THE LINK TO THE APPLICATION WORD DOCUMENT OR PDF THAT CAN BE EMAILED TO RAWHIDERESCUE@HOTMAIL.COM:\n http://members.petfinder.com/~NJ235/Forms/RawhideDogApplication.doc\n http://rawhiderescue.com/RawhideDogApplication.pdf\n\nOUR HOME PAGE:\n http://www.rawhiderescue.org",

            "description": "Beau (AKA Kovu) came into our rescue early last year. He was an energetic 5 month old Treeing Walker Coonhound puppy with a broken foot. He has also been deaf since birth. His family surrendered him when they realized that they could not provide the supervision needed to keep his leg in a cast or afford the additional medical care his injury necessitated. After the bones healed, he needed several months of rehab while on more sedated crate rest. It took several more months wean off medications, work off the stored energy, and learn to be a dog. Beau is now a 60lb, 2 year old handsome pup ready for his forever home.\nBeau is a special dog looking for a special person or family. He thrives on routine and is very affectionate with his people. He will bond closely with a strong leader and needs an experienced owner. He likes going on walks and exploring the yard with his nose. He enjoys playing with toys and cuddling with his people. At the end of the day, he likes nothing better than to snuggle next to his person and chew a Nylabone before falling asleep on the couch. Sometimes, he forgets his size and tries to be a lapdog. He has made friends with the resident cats and dogs in his foster home. Being deaf, Beau watches the other dogs for cues. He loves to wrestle when another young foster dog is available but usually respects the senior residents\u2019 boundaries. Beau sleeps in a crate at night and when his people are not home. He rides well in the car and knows to ask to go outside to potty.\nNow that Beau is finally ready for adoption, he is looking for a family that has the time, energy, and patience to continue training him, take him on walks, and play with him. He needs a fully fenced yard so he has somewhere safe to run and play. He would love another playful dog in the house. While Beau greatly enjoys the children in his foster home, his play can be too energetic for kids under 12. Beau is crate-trained and house-trained. He knows signs for \u201csit,\u201d \u201cdown,\u201d \u201ccome,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d \u201csettle,\u201d \u201ckiss,\u201d and \u201cgood boy.\u201d We are working on a few more including \u201cenough\u201d and \u201cstay.\u201d He walks well on a leash using a head collar. Due to his early medical issues, Beau missed out on some socialization time. He can be fearful of strangers outside the home and needs extra time to check out novel objects in his home. However, he has been very excited to meet new people in his foster home. His foster mom has been working with him to improve his stranger reactivity on walks. Although he has already made good progress, his new owner will need to adhere to the same protocols and continue the work. Beau\u2019s forever family must understand this and accept him as he is. While training a deaf hound dog is challenging, it can also be incredibly fulfilling. Beau is very food-motivated and eager to please. He has so much love to give that the effort is well-rewarded.\n\nBeau will not attend adoption events. Prospective adopters will need to meet Beau in his foster home. Please contact Kelly D. by email or text to learn more or to meet Beau. duirkat@gmail.com or 612-642-1424\n\nAdoption Fee: $350   (no checks) \n\n*REQUIRES FULLY FENCED YARD & NO KIDS UNDER 12 YEARS OLD*\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home.  An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home.  Sometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable.  There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months.  We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.   \n\nLast Hope, Inc. is an all volunteer, foster based, no kill rescue! You can see almost all of our dogs on Saturdays from 11-3 at the Burnsville PetSmart and at the Lakeville PetSmart. \n\nPolicies: You do not have to have a fence to adopt a dog from us, but some dogs will require a fence or acres to play, or an active family who will make sure the dog gets the exercise it needs to be happy.  Some dogs do not have the temperament that will do well with young children.   \n\nThe Adoption Fee is not enough to cover the vet bills.

            "description": "Dodson is a sweet senior who absolutely LOVES people. We expect that he can sense those people who are caring, compassionate, and willing to help him versus those who have subjected him to a life of neglect prior to joining our Safe House..\n\nDodson is an adorable Pitbull Mix, about 75 lbs and 9 \u2013 10 years old. He\u2019s a stocky boy with a cute waddling walk. He\u2019s a very easy-going and happy boy, especially when he receives lots of attention, petting, and playtime. He enjoys playing with toys, especially balls. \n\nDodson would do best as an only dog, so he can receive all the human attention and compassion he so deserves. He slowly warms up to female dogs but is scared and apprehensive around male dogs.\n\nWe suspect that, sadly, Dodson appears to be the result of very bad breeding. His front legs are splayed and it might appear he\u2019d have difficulty getting around. However, he does just fine! He does have a little difficulty getting in and out of the car and likely would have some difficulty in a home with a lot of stairs.\n\nDodson is housebroken, knows his basic manners, and walks nicely on a leash. He is a little nervous when riding in a car but overall does ok.\n\nDodson is fully vetted, up-to-date on all vaccinations, heartworm negative and on year-round heartworm preventative, neutered, and microchipped for permanent identification.\nPlease consider providing a loving forever home for Dodson in his twilight years. For more information or to apply to adopt this sweet senior, please contact BAARKDogRescue@gmail.com or 847-852-0895",

It's been said I'm wonderful, extremely intelligent, independent, sassy girl with lots of energy. Though I came to the shelter as a stray with an unknown past, they learn new things about me every day, I teach them a few things too.  I'm unsure how I would do living with small animals, as I've a very strong prey drive and incredibly stubborn. They are working on my lack of dog socialization skills, as well as my leash manners.  I'm certainly one of the smartest dogs they have had in this facility.  Due to my energy and need for training, I'm is looking for an adult home only, where my leader continues my routine to unlock my true potential.  I must be the only dog.  I would love a strong and physically active person who would engage my brain on a daily basis. I also like to go on 3+Mile walks everyday, after my walks I take a small break, then back to running around.\n\nBully/Malamute Breed Experience Required:\nPlease note, that Fern requires multiple visits with some intensive training to determine if a home visit is possible. Fern appreciates your understanding and patience.\n\nIf you have further questions, emails are the only method of communication at this time.

The petite pittie pooch is 45 pounds and an absolute dream. She looks to her people for love and reassurance because Belle is a bit shy. This may explain why she is a cuddler extraordinaire! There is one thing Belle likes as much as hugs - toys! She loves toys. She loves to chase a toy or ball but has not quite mastered the return of fetch yet. So cute!\n\nBelle loves to be outside and go for car rides. She walks well on a leash and enjoys greeting people in her neighborhood, though she is still very shy when initially meeting them. Belle loves walking in the woods and her confidence has been building while in her foster home. \n\nBelle has recently learned to use stairs and the awesomeness of a bed. She loves fruits and veggies: Broccoli and carrots are her favorites. When she is excited about something (walks, food, etc.) she gets chatty but she is typically a quiet girl. She is a low maintenance, easy gal.\n\nBelle enjoys leaning firmly against her people and likes a good belly rub. She is just such a love. She is a terrific dog and she is ready to be a part of YOUR family. Do you have a soft spot in your heart and your home for Belle? You can apply to adopt Belle at www.mostlymuttz.org/adoption-application/.",

He's in great shape, is moderately active, and gets along with everyone.  He's friendly, affectionate, and very willing to please.  He gets along with dogs of both sexes, as well as dog-savvy cats.  He would do best in a home with a compatible canine companion.  He loves older well-behaved children.  No small children and no big dogs please.  He's had all his teeth removed, but he doesn't need anything special except for softer food.  Ollie is housetrained, crate trained and leash trained.  His adoption fee is $100.  We would also consider a forever foster situation.  LOCAL ADOPTION ONLY.\n\nThis dog may be at one of the Prescott pet stores on Sat. If you're interested, please call in advance to confirm that we're bringing this dog and where we'll be. Call for more info. 928 708-0799.",

We found out that Karma has 2 bad hips and 2 bad knees...both her knees are torn ....this makes it hard for her to walk so she over compensates with the front and that puts stress and deterioration on her neck, shoulders, and back...as you can imagine...this is a chronic pain situation for her from neck to back knees and bless her heart...she has hid it well... this sweet petite girl wants to live and has tried very hard to live life to it's fullest since rescue.  She has had surgery on her knees and has recovered well, but this will be a chronic situation for her that will always require arthritis meds and supplements for her comfort.  Because of Karma's bad hips and back, she was not a candidate for the typical ACL surgery, but our vets did a modified surgery on her knees to give her some relief and a chance...if we didn't do this surgery then she would have to be euthanized...it would be cruel to keep her in that much chronic and debilitating pain. \n\n$150 adoption fee, spayed/neutered, microchipped, current vaccinations, and house trained and kennel trained.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION:  If you are interested in this pet you must fill out the Adoption Application\u2026which you can find on this site or you can copy and paste this link \u2026 http://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php    \nThis does not obligate you in any way.  If this does not work for you then you can email us at midsouthpets@aol.com for one.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT CONTACT US BEFORE READING THE FOLLOWING INFO:  \nYour inquiry may not get a reply if you have not read the info we have taken the time to provide.  PLEASE READ about our ADOPTION PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS provided on this site before contacting us.  You can find it quickly by clicking on our NAME or MORE ABOUT US in the column to the right of this pet\u2019s description.  All your questions can be answered by reading the following info provided below.  Our pets are fostered in the Memphis Area, a tri-state area, TN/AR/MS.  Most are fostered in Red Banks, MS.  \n\nWe do not allow meetings with any of our dogs until we have your Adoption Application.  Adopting a new family member should involve a well-thought out and deliberate process. This is not an impulse purchase. Please understand that we do not want these animals to be homeless again. We try to complete the process as quickly as possible and appreciate all the applications and will consider each and every one we receive. \n\nFilling out the Adoption Application does not obligate you in any way, but simply tells us a little bit about you and whether you and this pet would be a good fit for each other.  We will call you after we receive your application and answer all your questions and talk to you about this pet.  After being approved, we will set up a time to bring the pet to meet you and your family and pets or set up a time for you to meet the pet at the foster home.\n\nNO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  Rescue is a full time job every day.  Please know because we are so very busy with the dogs along with processing applications, updating webpage\u2019s, rescuing, in many vet appointments, caring for seniors and hospice dogs, etc, etc that we are not able to return phone calls or emails asking if this dog is still adoptable, how much is it to adopt, is it house trained etc\u2026We have included all the info we have on this dog at this current time and update the bio as we learn more about them.  We kennel train all the dogs and will indicate if there are housebreaking issues that we have discovered.  We update our site regularly so if the dog is listed here they are in fact adoptable, but may have applications coming in on them, so if you are interested, you need to get your application in now.\n\n**WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY ADOPTION**  Our first concern is the happiness and welfare of the animal.  We respect our potential adoptors and appreciate your interest in adopting one of our pets.  We care about you too and that you are getting the right fit for your home and lifestyle.  By following our process, together we can make sure you are getting the right pet.**\n\nNOTE: We prefer to adopt in the Mid-South AREA, usually no more than 1-2 hours away in driving distance. It is up to the foster home, how far they are willing to drive. We rarely adopt long distance, but will consider each and every application. \n \nMidSouth Animal Rescue League is an all breed, 501c3, non-profit organization that prefer to rescue senior dogs and special cases.  WE LOVE ROTTWEILERS...With 20 years of experience with our beloved ROTTWEILER breed, and little help for this breed in our area, we try to focus on rescuing them and try not to ever have to turn any away that need us\u2026especially the seniors that end up in shelters.  Currently, we have several senior rottweilers in our hospice foster program.  We always need more fosters so that we never have to say NO to them or other seniors.  \n\nWe have also started a community relief effort specifically in the Red Banks, MS area not far from us, called The Dog House Project, where we go door to door providing dog houses to dogs on chains and other dogs and cats without proper shelter, including straw in cold temps, as well as food and other supplies as needed.   We offer free spay/neuter services to those animals and continue to check on them all year.  To date many have been spayed and neutered and some have been surrendered from their neglected lives on chains.  We are making a difference and need your donations to continue this program.  We always need igloo type dog houses.  \n\nMidSouth Animal Rescue League relies on the kindness, generosity, and financial support of people like you so that we can continue to rescue and care for dogs like this one. We are a group of dedicated volunteers who respond to animals in need in shelters, strays, and from individuals. We receive no federal or state funds and are supported solely by private donations. \n\nMany of the animals we save are in need of special medical care or surgery to bring them back to health before they can be placed. Veterinary care, vaccinations, tests, x-rays, medications, spay and neutering, heartworm prevention, flea/tick prevention, worming, food, kennels, grooming, and other supplies are provided for each dog while in our care. \n\n",

            "description": "\"Trust the process. Your time is coming.\" My name is Rossi and I just know that my time is coming. My time to find my forever home, that is! I have experienced some things in my 4 years that have made me slow to trust, but for anyone willing to show me some patience, I will be the best friend you've ever known. I guess I should start this off by telling you a little more about myself. I'm a 60 pound Black Mouth Cur/Shepherd mix. I am looking for a home without kids or cats because both are too scary for me. I like other dogs though, and would love to have a respectful and playful dog friend in my forever home. I also need a home with a privacy fenced yard so that we have a safe place for some playtime and exercise while we get to know one another. My perfect forever human needs to be someone who is able to provide me with structure and boundaries so that I can follow their lead. You see, I am really just a sweet and submissive boy, but without a strong leader I sometimes try to be the leader and that makes me all kinds of nervous; I would so much rather follow your lead! Once we have that forever bond, I would love to join you on some outdoor adventures, as I love to join my foster family on walks and hikes! If you think it might be time for a sweet boy like me in your life, then fill out that adoption application today.\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

            "description": "Thank you for your inquiry. Pickles has an adopter but we have to wait for them to go pick him up after the stay at home is lifted.  Once he is picked up we will remove his profile. Please do not write to us for an application. Sorry for any inconvenience.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Pickles!  Pickles is a fun loving, good natured cutie with great expressive ears and a soft coat.  He is about 2 1/2 years old and 8 lbs. \n\nPickles may be a tiny guy but he comes with a big personality.  He loves to be loved and when you go to pet him he immediately rolls on his back and wiggles around. Pickles is great with everyone, of all ages.  Humans aren\u2019t the only ones he gets along with!  He runs, wrestles and chases the other fosters dogs in the house and he gets along well with them.  Pickle lives with cats but he has been known to chase them around the house.\n\nPickles is mostly house trained with few accidents and he usually goes on the pee pads. He could use some help getting it down pat.  He also knows a few commands and comes when you call his name but like some rescue dogs, this smartie just needs a little time and consistency to master it all.  \n\nPickles is quite inquisitive and excited for life.  He loves to bathe in the sun, look for squirrels and ensure you are safe from strangers.  But when night falls, Pickles loves to bury himself in blankets and burrow in the bed under some covers.  He has no problem through the night and just wants to be near to you. Are you the one to give him the life he deserves?  \n\nPickles wouldn\u2019t do well left alone for a full work day and would like to have a canine companion if his parents are gone that long. He would do fine with no other dog as long as someone was around during the day.\n\nPickles is being fostered in Napa. CA.  His adoption fee is $275.00.\n\nAll our dogs are in private foster homes and arrangements to meet our dogs occur after an application has been received.\n\nIf you would like to know more about this sweet boy or receive an application to adopt, please contact us at Dogzonerescue@yahoo.com.\n",

            "description": "Honey came to us with an injury that seems to be from being hit by a car.  No broken bones but she had some type of muscle and nerve damage in her right from leg.  She came to us not being able to use it much at all with open soars on her leg and head.  After getting xrays and having a few visits to Veterinarians we came to the conclusion to try to rehabilitate her leg on our own instead of amputating her leg.  \n\nThe sores on her head and leg have completely headed but we still deal with some on her foot from her dragging it at times.  We have tired chiropractic care, we are now trying water therapy, and plan to try acupuncture and micro current therapy next.  She has gotten a lot of movement back in her leg and seems to be getting some nerve response back as well.  She couldn't feel her food up to the sore on her wrist area for a while.  Now she seems to be responding to stimulation between her outside two toes.  She is improving!!!\n\nHoney is a great girl.  She is very attentive to everything around her.  She acts a bit neurotic when it comes to lasers or any kind of flash of light.  Sometimes shadows get her excited too.  She loves to chase the flashlight at night.  She loves to play chase with her fur foster siblings and steal the toys from them just to loose interest and move on to another toy quickly.

Collie/Australian Shepherd mix. With her always wagging tail and love of people and friends, this girl is a true delight! She loves dancing around with her toys and is all about having fun.  Lassie loves playing with the other dogs in her foster home, though true to breed, can also be seen trying to herd them. Intelligent and adventurous, she would love a home that will both mentally and physically stimulate her. She enjoys swimming in her foster family\u2019s pool and can often be found stealing tennis balls from her canine friends who play fetch in the water. When Lassie crashes for a nap, she likes to curl up on the couch or a lounge chair on the deck and simply melts into a scrumptious cuddle buddy. She also sleeps in bed with her foster parents every night. Lassie is house trained, walks well on a leash, and knows how to sit and come when instructed.  A vocal girl, she makes the most precious happy noises and loves to chat with her human and canine friends.\n\nWith the energy level and mouthiness of an Australian Shepherd, Lassie is not suitable for a home with cats or young children. She would enjoy a home with a large fenced yard and another active dog to play with.\n\nPlease note that Lassie has hip dysplasia and will only be adopted to a home that continues giving her daily (over the counter) Moboflex, CBD and fish oil and prescription pain medication on an as needed basis.\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

            "description": "Daisy has been through a lot in her life thus far and she still just wants to please people.  She absolutely loves to cuddle and be right next to her person.  She is completely potty trained, crate trained if needed (she just lays in her foster moms bed all day), and leash trained.  Daisy is an older girl that just wants to relax and cuddle.  She has not been around any cats.  She doesn't like hyper active dogs or humans in her face.    She is always super excited to see her humans for the first time in the morning or when they come home from work or an errand.  She was in a home that didn't appreciate her so it takes her time to trust people.  Once she trusts someone she gets very attached.  She doesn't jump on her people but she will jump 5 feet in the air when she is super excited.  She will go outside to potty and come right back in to cuddle.  She is not an outdoor dog!  She just has to get comfortable in her environment with new friends and people.  Daisy is an amazing dog and deserves the best with what she has been through.  \n\nIf you would like to visit or adopt Daisy please visit our website at www.ShannonFarmz.com and fill out an adoption application or contact us through petfinder if you have any questions.  Daisy is fully vaccinated, spayed, microchipped, and heartworm negative.  She has been kept on preventative wormer since she has been with our rescue.  Thank you for looking at Daisy.  She will make someone an amazing companion.",

He's housebroken and walks well on a leash, and would love to find a home with a couple adults who either have no kids or whose kids have since moved out.  He'd be best with no other pets.  Ideally, Strut is looking for a home with a nice fenced yard in the country--he's not a city boy as the noises are stressors for him.  He's a little cautious at first, due to his anxiety, but he warms up quickly and can be very sweet.",

She is very protective and loyal and may benefit from additional training to improve her social skills and confidence. Training would also be a great bonding experience between Esme and her new family! Esme is still adjusting to being at the shelter, but we think with time and patience she will become more trusting.\n",

            "description": "Trix is a 7 year old female Shih Tzu rescued from a puppy mill.\nShortly after her rescue we noticed a large mass on her stomach. We scheduled a removal and biopsy and unfortunately it was a very invasive form of cancer. While the vet was able to remove the tumor entirely, it is very likely that she will develop others. We check her tummy daily for any new lumps or bumps, which is easy to do because Trix LOVES having her belly rubbed. She has come a very long way since her rescue and she will even dance and kick her feet when she wants attention. New people still make her nervous and she will require a family with patience who will understand she needs to trust you before she opens up. Never approach Trix from behind, she is easily startled and will snip. We believe a house without small children would be ideal for Trix. She loves treats but still doesn\u2019t take them directly from our hands. She will play with toys occasionally. She does fine with cats. She is an older dog so she can get grumpy towards the younger fosters when she doesn\u2019t want to be bothered. She does enjoy sitting in your lap for short periods of time. She is a very sweet girl and will make a great companion dog with just a little time and patience. \n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA. \n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

They came to Best Friends in January 2019 and are both neutered and up to date on vaccinations. Their dad was an older gentleman that lived in the city and did not have any family. Unfortunately, he passed away right around Christmas time and he did not have anyone checking on him. When someone finally did check on him, they found that he had passed away in his bed and his two sweet dogs were laying by his side watching over him. They love to lay together and do well with other dogs. They are currently staying with our loving staff at our Joppa location but want so badly for someone to give them a comfortable loving home.\n\nRusty is around 11. He acts like a puppy in a very senior body. He has trouble walking and will need a splint changed every few months at around $250. Chocky is mellow and around 12.\u00a0\u00a0 They are both 50-60 pounds and are pretty relaxed most of the time.\u00a0 Rusty is the more vocal of the two and he vocalizes when he is excited, like when visitors come and at feeding time.\u00a0 Rusty is on pain management for the rest of his life and tolerates it well.\u00a0 Chocky is overall healthy for his age.\u00a0 Both do have some age related issues such as joint pain.\u00a0 Chocky does occasionally have a gastro upset.\u00a0 They are very bonded and must stay together. They cannot go home with little dogs or cats.\n",

He loves squeaky toys and is very playful. He is a strong boy and is currently working on his leash manners in our training program. Cuddy does have canine elbow dysplasia and is currently on medication for pain management. Cuddy came to Best Friends from BARCS in June of 2018 with his brother who has since passed over the rainbow bridge. Cuddy does prefer people over the company of other dogs but would love to find a home that he can have to himself and share lots of love. \n\nIf you are interested in more information or would like to meet Cuddy please contact Best Friends forever at 410-671-7529",

            "description": "Red is a sweet, retired senior, 10 years old, Blue Tick-Bloodhound mix dog and long-time shelter resident. Sometimes the shy guy - he is playful and affectionate once he gets to know you. Mellow now, in his senior years - he enjoys walks on or off-leash. And he likes playing with toys and fetching balls. Red has been at the shelter almost 4 years. He was surrendered in 2015. And while he has adopted us as his own and is comfortable here; he deserves a family and home of his own in his twilight years. The shelter is not the same as a home and long winter evenings at the shelter can be lonely and boring; sometimes loud and unsettling with new dogs in nearby kennels. We wish for Red to have warm, quiet companionable evenings in a home of his own. He is low maintenance and was trusted inside in his former home. If you are looking for a faithful, mellow solo side-kick, Red is your dog.\n\nHe aint heavy, hes our Red. Red can be shy towards people and keep his distance until he gets to know you, which means he doesnt always show well to potential adopters. Once he trusts you he will stay by your side. He can encounter other dogs out and about and greet, but does not seem to get along with other dogs long-term; and Red cannot go to a home with cats. While situation dependent; Red will mostly likely need his new home to have a fenced yard.",

I get along with other dogs very well.  I am a bit shy with people but warm up fast and love to sit in laps. I am the perfect addition to any family!\n\nIf you are not able to adopt me, please consider virtually adopting me or coming to spend time with me on the weekends!\n\nPlease visit havenacs.org for our visitation hours, information about the adoption process and to fill out an application! \n",

She is 4 year old Lab and Terrier mix. Allie had her puppies outside when she was a stray just before Christmas in 2018. Make A Difference rescue quickly went and rescued the family. Allie is now ready to start the next chapter of her life. Allie can be a little skittish when meeting new people. She is a very sweet and gentle girl. Allie has the most beautiful soulful eyes. She is good with other dogs after a proper introduction is done. She is good with cats. Children 14 years old or older. Her forever home must have a fenced yard where Allie can safely run and play. She is spayed, up to date on her vaccinations, on heart worm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Allie is looking for a patient and loving family to continue to help her blossom into the most amazing dog we know she is.\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Allie\u2019s adoption fee is $275.\n",

He is a big boy weighing approximately 100#. YOU ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE LOTS OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE GREAT PYRENEES BREED!!!!!Titus loves being around people and is very affectionate. He absolutely loves to play!!! Titus loves going for car rides and going for walks. He is dog social. Unfortunately, we do not know how he is with cats. NO CHILDREN!!! His forever home must have a totally enclosed physically fenced yard where Titus can safely run and play. He is neutered, up to date on his vaccinations, on heart worm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Titus is very excited to find his forever family where he will be cherished and go on adventures.\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Titus\u2019 adoption fee is $275.\n",

She is currently working on crate training and she is muzzle trained. She needs a special person who will give her the proper time to warm up to them. Once she does, she is a big cuddle bug. Val enjoys riding in the passenger seat of the car and going on long walks. Her ideal home would be with teenagers and up and no feline friends in the house. She does prefer her doggy friends to be male. This super sweet girl has a dedicated group of staff and volunteers who will help make her adoption successful. Do you have what it takes to be Valkyrie's eternal friend?\n\nValkyrie is two years old and weighs about 60 pounds.\n \nValkyrie's adoption fee is $200; she is microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and spayed. Some of our pets are in foster care and not located at the shelter. If you are interested in a specific pet, contact the shelter at (618) 939-7389 to arrange a meeting.",

It would be best for her to be the only dog in a household where she can get all the love and attention she deserves. Journey thrives with calmer people so a household without young children would be ideal for her.  She is not the type of dog who wants to go for long leisurely walks...she is completely content to have a yard to chase her jolly ball,  a kiddie pool to splash in, and someone to give her endless amounts of belly rubs.  Journey has some cattle dog in her so she loves having a job to do or play any game that challenges her.   She has been working with trainers on her manners and, where she used to resist training,  she now loves it!!! \n\nHer date of birth is 7/8/2017 and she weighs about 30 pounds. \n\n*We did receive a donated Wisdom Panel DNA test for Journey and we found out she is: 37.5% Standard Bulldog, 25% American Staffordshire Terrier, 25% Australian Cattle Dog, and 12.5% Breed Groups: Terrier & Companion.\n\nIf you have been looking for a playful, sweet, small dog, submit an adoption application for Journey at http://www.fayettefcar.com/applicationform, where you can also review FCAR\u2019s adoption requirements.\n\nAll FCAR adoptable dogs have been spayed or neutered, are current on all vaccines, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped, and come with a 30-day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required for Journey.\n",

She is smart, listens well, and is delighted by affection, especially belly rubs. Her potty training is perfect and she is cooperative when crating is needed. Although she is a bit slow to warm up to new people, the pay-off for giving her time is her trust and adoration.\nCrickets ideal situation will be a relatively quiet home without lots of visitors, a sizable yard with at least a 5-foot fence, adopters who are willing to keep an eye on her when she is in the yard, either no other dogs or a male dog who is interested in having a companion, and no cats. If leash walking is desired, she will need an experienced person who can help her manage her reactivity to dogs and squirrels she sees on the street. Otherwise, she is happy to get her exercise by exploring and running in her yard.\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative and microchipped. A dogs adoption fee is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

He has a sensitivity to fleas and battles skin issues. But as long as he is kept on flea prevention and grain-free food, his skin is good. He is not a fan of cats, so should not be in a home with any. Hudson LOVES to eat and can be a hoarder when it comes to food. He needs work on leash walking and would be better with one on one attention. Hudosn loves soaking up the sun and car rides, but he drools profusely during the ride. He is a great dog he just isn't great with other male dogs. But he is super smart, eager-to-please, and very protective and will make someone a wonderful pet. He's a Charming little man. He loves to snuggle and is just the cutest little thing.",

He would love a home with someone who likes to go for long walks, runs, or who likes to play fetch. He prefers not to share his love with anyone but his people so a single pet household would be best. He is very energetic so we recommend a home with older children.\n\nSalsa is located at our rescue center.\n\nAll dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered (age appropriate), and heartworm negative. All dogs are given monthly flea/tick preventative, monthly heartworm preventative, and are dewormed regularly. Dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are microchipped. Adoption fee is $50. Home visit and vet reference required. Applications can be put in online at http://www.troyanimalrescueproject.org/adopt.php or in person at our rescue center.\n\nThe address for our rescue center is 34 County Road 2266, Brundidge, AL 36010. We are one turn off Hwy 167. If you use Google maps, type in Troy Animal Rescue Project and it will take you right to us. Hours of operation are from 10-3 daily. We are open Saturdays and Sundays. No appointment necessary for pets that are located at the rescue center. Appointments must be made to visit pets in foster homes. Location information will be listed beside the pets name if they are at a location other than our rescue center.\n\nQuestions can be emailed to troyanimalrescueproject@gmail.com or call 334-508-2367.",

Two very long years of wishing he had a place to call home. Peanut loves his foster daddy, but he and the other foster dogs don't see eye to eye most of the time so they must be separated and share the time in the back yard. Peanut loves to go for walks and love to play with toys. He is around 3 years old and has tons of spunk and sass with a quirky personality. Peanut needs a strong authority figure or he will push buttons just to see how much he can get away with. But with the right guidance, Peanut is a terrific boy eager to please his owners. Peanut is fully vetted, kennel trained, and house trained.\n\nTo adopt Peanut, complete the adoption application at AAVArescue.com",

            "description": "*** Sweet Stella can ONLY be adopted in the NY/NJ area. She was born around the summer of 2018. Approximately 55lbs. Possibly a Black Mouth Cur Mix.*** adoption instructions below\n\nIn order to adopt Stella you must agree to meet with her and her trainer in NJ on at least 3 separate occasions, both with and without your dog if applicable. \n\nSee Stella on The Dodo at: https://www.facebook.com/thedodosite/videos/1376367309191892/\n\nStella came to us when we got an urgent plea from a good Samaritan to take a dog belonging to an estranged relative. This poor pup was being kept in a back room, chained to an old broken mattress, often with no food or water. Being a large, energetic puppy, she was often difficult to handle, but rather than trying to train her, Stella had been beaten when she made mistakes. She was one of the saddest and most depressing examples of neglect we had ever seen. \n\nStella shows just how resilient a pupper can be. Think of her as a shy Party girl.\n\nAfter gaining her health and strength back, she spent several months living in a special board and train facility where she learned manners and how to greet people in a polite way - as well as learning a lot about life itself. Shes learned that humans can be and are loving towards her, and in turn shes learned she can hang out calmly. However she still is (and will always be) FULL of energy and would love a very active family.\n\nHer early years have left her with certain behavioral issues around impulse control and meeting new friends which she, with the help of her new family, will need to continue to work on for some time. However this sweet princess wants more than anything to please the humans she knows and trusts. Once shes comfortable, she just wants to have a good time.\n\nAfter training camp, Stella was taken in by an amazing foster family who are continuing her training and medication program. She also gets to spend lots of time playing with her foster dog brother and her outlook in life is so joyful.\n\nStella will always need a special environment, though, with forever parents who are willing to help her learn about the world at her pace. She will do best in a home with no small children as she can be overly exuberant when unsure.\n\nThat said, with a few slow introductions Stella can and in fact SHOULD live with another dog if possible. The ideal family would be one where someone is home most of the time or can bring her to an appropriate day camp program. \n\nStella still goes back to training camp from time to time and sees a special behavioral vet who proscribes her medication to help her deal with some of her anxiety behaviors. \n\nHer camp carer says, Stella is having a great time at camp! She is always curious about new smells and enjoys the company of her human friends. She loves to run when she's in the big yard and enjoy the tranquil sounds at times. Stella is such a beauty and we love having her here at camp. She's got personality and energy for miles and thats one of our favorite things about her. Stella has so much personality; she is silly, full of so much excitement and energy. She also can be super sweet and whenever she sees you coming toward her, her butt just wont stop wiggling! \n\nIf you think you can give Stella all the love she deserves and would like to meet her, please go to Petstablished.com or follow the link below to complete an application to adopt. All of our animals are in foster homes. For the sake of our animals and foster families, you must have an approved application with references before you can meet them. \n\nhttps://petstablished.com/pets/public/379676\n\nIn order to receive a speedy response to any inquiry, please email us directly at Info@ShelterChic.org or check out our website ShelterChic.org where you will find the answer to most questions about our adoption process and fees. Please remember that our organization is run entirely by volunteers in our spare time, and emails are responded to in order of importance. If you do not hear from us and cannot find the information needed on our website or in our animals profile, please reach out to us again. For more images and tales of our pets in foster-care check out our social media pages @shelterchic \n\n***PLEASE DO NOT email to ask if the animal you are interested in is still available. Just check Petstablished, if they are there, they are available! Please note that 3rd party adoption sites take 6-12 hours to refresh. Allpaws.com and petharbor.com are 4+ months out of date. We are not associated with Petcurious.com in anyway. Please do not apply for animals you see there without checking they are on the Petstablished website first.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nMISSY MAE STEAL YOUR HEART. Missy Mae is a friendly Chihuahua mix with a cute little snaggle tooth. She is nearly 10 years old, in good health and weighs about 14 pounds. Missy Mae loves car rides and her squeaky/chewy toys. She's house- and leash trained, and actually enjoys time to herself, so owners who work outside the home would be fine so long as they keep in mind that she has a tiny bladder. She does not get along with other pets or children. Missy Mae would be very happy with a single person or a pair of empty nesters/retirees.\n\nMissy Mae is spayed, heartworm negative, microchipped and up to date on her vaccinations. She is affectionate but sometimes she also needs her space and might seem standoffish. She enjoys going for walks but needs to avoid other dogs. In return for a quiet home with patient, loving people, Missy Mae will be a fun and loving companion for years to come. Her adoption fee is being covered by a TDR Angel.\nAvailable at Tired Dog Rescue in Gulfport, MS.

The kind who love so deeply, they would move mountains for an animal in need of grace. Rezendez really, really needs one of those kind of humans. We found him a local shelter where he'd been rescued from a life outside, with no shelter, on the end of a heavy chain. His world was small and the humans in it were not kind. Now that he's safe with us, we hope Rezendez can get a second chance with someone worthy of his trust and love. He would do best in a quiet, adult home with someone who will give him the time and space to settle in and feel at home. He's got a nice, even energy and seems to like other dogs. If you have a dog who can show him the ropes, that might be exactly what he needs. If you're looking for a dog you can help, we would love to see this gentle, loving boy find his happy ever after.\n",

            "description": "Parker is a handsome 6 to 7-year-old hound-bully breed mix that comes to Westport Animal Control after being abandoned on a cold, sleety day in Westport.  While he needs a bit of time to get to know strangers, some walks and yummy treats are the way to his heart.  He is loving and affectionate with staff and volunteers.  He wants to give hugs and is quite a leaner too.  He is quite charming.  He quite enjoys playing with toys and is happy to plop them in your lap to be thrown.  After a tumultuous life, we are sure, Parker is reclaiming his doggie joy, and we are so happy to help in that regard.  He has tested well with other dogs - once he gets over his initial excitement.  For additional photos and videos, please visit WASA's FB at:  http://www.facebook.com/westportwasa.  For additional information about Parker, please contact WASA by calling 203 557 0361 or by sending an email to wasa1@optonline.net.",

Marvin will need mandatory training session booked in with a WAG approved trainer.\nHouse trained? Yes\nKids? No\nCats? No\nDogs? I would like to be the only dog in the house and can get excited when I see dogs on walks. I get along only with some dogs and in the right situations.\nMedical Needs: Anxiety medication\n\nMy Perfect Match:\n\n-Has a safe a secure fenced yard. I may never be a candidate for being off leash or going to public parks and dog parks as I get overwhelmed easily.\n\n-Is willing to take a few trips to WAG to get to know me before taking me home. I am fearful of strangers when I first meet them.\n\n-Has experience with fearful dogs. My reactions to my fears can include trying to run away (I am very strong!) or flattening myself to the ground and not wanting to move!\n\n-Has lots of patience and understanding of my past - I did not develvope in a normal environment so my needs are different than your average dog.\n\n-Loves goofy loveable quirky boys. I am so much fun to play with when I feel safe and can be off leash in a secure area. I love to play fetch and tug-of-war and soccer, and have lots of energy!\n\n-Will continue with my training and keep me on leash. My training needs will be more about confidence building and creating positive associations rather than basic commands.\n\n-Will buy me a GPS tracker that I must wear on walks to keep me safe! I am a flight risk so this is a requirment.\n\n-Is strong! I am strong \n\n-Will love me forever no matter what!\n\n \n\nAbout Me:\n-I LOVE to play with any ball of any size!\n\n-I love to swim, any time of the year.\n\n-I am very busy but am learning to relax with the help of medication.\n\n-I am very shy meeting new people, you may need to meet me a few times before we are friends.\n\n-I am still nervous going on walks and would like a quiet yard in my new home.\n\n-I need lots of gentle training.\n\n-I am nervous of loud noises and new things and will need someone who is patient with me.\n\n-I have never lived in a home before.\n\nAPPLY FOR MARVIN!\nMy Story:\nI was surrendered to WAG after my previous family could no longer take care of me. I was left outside a lot, my owners no longer had the time for me. I hope to find an amazing new home that is excited to have me as a member of the family!

A little shy at first (probably because of history before rescued). But then when she comes out of her bubble she's so much fun! \nLearns very quickly. I taught her sit, stay, shake, and come all in one days worth of training. (And I'm not a great trainer! ?) \nCan be full of energy, or completely down to earth depending on the human's mood.\"\n\nMy adoption fee covers 3 rounds of parvo/distemper shots, my bordatella, my rabies shot, my spay, my microchip, heartworm test and the flea and heartworm preventative treatment I've been on since I entered this great program!\n\nSince NKHC requires a home check (we arent inspecting your life. Just wanna make sure it's safe ie: not a hoarding situation, a reasonable way to walk the doggy without throwing it on the highway, things like that) we do not adopt further than a reasonable driving distance (2.5 hours max).",

This has given us some very valuable information to share with interested adopters:\n1. She prefers to be called by her full name, Remy The Double Stuff Oreo. (Remy is a bit chonky so she is currently on a diet. Her ideal Oreo size is single-stuff, around 45-50 lbs).\n2. Remy is a world class snuggler. She loves to plop herself next to you, roll over with her feet in the air, and fall asleep while you rub her tummy.\n3. Remy walks well using a harness.\n4. She wants to be an acrobat when she grows up. She's been practicing her somersaults-into-a-beetle-dance routine and it's really coming along!\n5. When she sees someone she knows, her entire back end wiggles like it's going to just dance right off her body.\n6. Remy is FANTASTIC in her crate. She is crated periodically throughout the day and at night to sleep, and doesn't make a peep!\n7. Remy definitely still has some puppy energy at approximately 3 years old but tires out pretty easily. She snorts in her sleep like a little piglet.\n8. Remy is house-trained.\nHer foster parents describe Remy as \"a real sweetheart\" and \"super easy\" and \"an endearing little imp.\" All she needs is her very own person! If you are interested in giving Remy a home, please email us at info@carolinehumane.org or call us at 410.820.1600.",

Because the owner had three other dogs she decided she could not deal with him and took him to animal control. We were devastated to find out he was there and immediately rescued him. He is 13 years old and would not likely get adopted. We have had him checked over by our vet and he is in good health . We believe his potty habits changed because he missed the owner. We haven't had him long yet, but he is not skittish anymore and is starting to give kisses now that he is getting attention. Sometime that's all is needed is a loving home. Picture up soon.",

His favorites, though, are plush squeaker toys. He knows commands such as sit, stay, drop, and leave it when playing. Blue also enjoys going for walks with his people. He is very polite when walking on a leash. Blue is becoming very mannerly and practices good listening skills. \n\nBlue does enjoy low-key times. When he isn't playing, you would love to be hanging out with his forever family. He is very loyal. Blue likes to stay close to the action, but he doesn't need much affection. You can find Blue wherever his people are. \n\nBlue is house trained. He is also crate trained, although he does just fine when he is left alone. Blue would thrive in a home in which he is the only pet. He would also prefer a home with older children or no children, as he often gets nervous. \n\nBlue is currently located at the Sanctuary in Marion, WI. If you're interested in making him part of your family, please complete an online application. Our adoption team will review it. When an application is approved, we will be in touch to schedule a time for you to meet him.",

Zeva's favorite part of the day is cuddle time! \n\nWhen she's not cuddling, Zeva does enjoy staying active. She loves going for walks and playing with her toys. Her favorite toys are Kongs because there's always a special surprise that comes with them! Sometimes Zeva does get so excited that she forgets her manners, but she responds to a gentle reminder to calm down. \n\nZeva is house trained and crate trained. Zeva also knows commands such as sit, stay, drop, release, and leave it. While she does get along with most other dogs, Zeva would thrive as an only pet because she prefers to be the center of attention. \n\nZeva is currently located at the Sanctuary in Marion, WI.

Not only is Precious Bella looking for a family, but she's also searching for her forever walking partner. She loves to go on adventures and enjoys her semi-active lifestyle. Some have said she walks to fulfill a mission!\n\nWhen Precious Bella isn't on the prowl, she likes to spend quality time with her people. She loves to sit right next to those she loves and be petted. Precious Bella turns into a loveable girl when it's time to relax. \n\nPrecious Bella would do best in a home with no other pets. She needs some practice on becoming potty trained, so she is looking for a patient family. Precious Bella knows some basic commands such as sit, stay, and drop. She is also crate trained and knows how to walk politely on a leash. \n\nPrecious Bella is currently located at the Sanctuary in Marion, WI. If you're interested in making her part of your family, please complete an online application. Our adoption team will review it. When an application is approved, we will be in touch to schedule a time for you to meet her.",

            "description": "Meet Will, a happy boy in search of his forever home. Will has the most adorable smile and wants to make everyone around him happy. Will likes to be close to his people but doesn't need a lot of affection. Will wants a home that can give him the essentials. Because of Will's maturity, he prefers low-key days. He doesn't need a lot of toys and doesn't need to be the center of attention. Will does enjoy the occasional stroll around the neighborhood, though. This old man still likes to get out and be rambunctious! \n\nThey say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but Will is proving them wrong! Will knows basic commands such as sit and stay. He is also working on his manners. He wants to put in the effort with his forever family in exchange for all of his love. \nWill's perfect home would be one in which he is the only pet. He's looking for a patient family because he is unsure about most things. He will need some help adjusting to a crate but will do best crated when he is left alone. He occasionally gets nervous or will have a potty accident when left alone. \n\nWil is currently located at the Sanctuary in Marion, WI. If you're interested in making Will part of your family, please complete an online application. Our adoption team will review it. When an application is approved, we will be in touch to schedule a time for you to meet him.",

He is a solid, stocky fellow who would love to be a lap dog if he wasn't so big. Big or not, he still likes to cuddle. He enjoys riding in the car and going for long walks. He also likes to play fetch and is eager to please. He gets along with most dogs and is good with people. He isn't fond of the screaming, pinching toddlers, but is fine with older children and adults of all ages. Rocky is a loving, loyal fellow who deserves a great forever home where he will be appreciated for the terrific dog he is. He will make a fantastic Prince Charming if you give him a chance.",

With the help of his dedicated foster mom, Kristine, he has been learning how to be a dog instead of a ghost flitting around scared constantly. The process can be long and involved, but seeing the progress inch by inch is so rewarding. He's working on recovering in our Make Me Brave program and he's already revealed a quirky and fun side, despite his shyness. We look forward to discovering more about this 4 year old boy as he improves his socialization skills with humans.\n\nYOU CAN SPONSOR EGON'S CARE IN RESCUE BY CLICKING ON THE SPONSOR BUTTON ON THIS PAGE or DIRECTLY ON THE RESCUE'S WEBSITE: www.onmywayhomerescue.com.  Thank you so very much for caring and supporting our rescue mission!  \n\n\n",

IF YOU MEET OUR CRITERIA FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE PROFILE TO COMPLETE OUR APPLICATION. THANK YOU!\n\nWe don\u2019t know for sure what breed mix Betty is, but we made our best guess. Betty is a stunning, young, athletic and energetic dog who is enthusiastic about everything. She loves to sprint, wrestle, jog, fetch, hike, swim, camp...and then snuggle all night long. She is insecure about meeting new people or dogs on leash, but once she breaks the ice, she is a real sweetie and a lighthearted goofball. Her foster mom\u2019s favorite things to do with Betty is to throw balls into the waves on the Oregon coast for Betty to retrieve, and to rest her head on Betty like a big furry pillow. \n\nBetty needs a home with someone who is as active and energetic as she is. She  needs a home with adults only, and needs someone with previous dog ownership experience. She can only go to a home with another active young dog who likes to run and wrestle and share their toys with her and a yard with a tall, secure fence. Betty isn\u2019t aggressive towards cats, but most kitties would find her obnoxious and overwhelming. Betty is potty trained and crate trained, but shouldn\u2019t be left alone all day long while her human family members work a 9-5 schedule. \n\nBetty is a smart cookie who loves to be challenged. She enjoys K9 Nosework (sniffing games) and agility classes, and has completed obedience training at Sit Means Sit. In fact, Sit Means Sit has offered her new owner complimentary training sessions!!! \n\nAdoption Process: We are not first come first served. Indigo Rescue focuses on finding good matches between dogs and families to ensure life long adoptions. We deliver all dogs to their new homes. All of our dogs are in foster homes. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting one of our dogs, please use the following link and complete our Adoption Application. You can either scan your completed application and email it to us at: info@indigorescue.org, or you can fax it to us at: 888-502-7660.\nThe link is not live, so you will need to copy and paste it into your browser: https://storage.googleapis.com/gator-users/user-680788/documents/d1742bff02e44c2ea25649cb45df5103/Pet%20Application%20Form%20December%202020.pdf\n\nIf the dog you're interested in seems compatible with your lifestyle we'll set up a time for you to meet the dog privately.\nPLEASE NOTE: Indigo Rescue only adopts to homes within 30 miles of Beaverton because our volunteers deliver all of our dogs to their adoptive homes. We work very hard to create a family of our Indigo Rescue adopters because we want to be close enough to help in case there are any problems. We want everyone to be happy and successful!\n\n**ALL of our dogs, puppies, cats, kittens and rabbits come vaccined to their age, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting and saving a life.",

An MRI determined that blunt force trauma caused a fracture to his spine that was never treated. With intensive physical therapy, our strong-willed warrior with the now-gorgeous coat is running, playing and ready for a home of his own! Justus absolutely adores his humans, including older children, but needs to be the only pet in his home. And he is reactive to loud noises, so his home should be in a quiet suburb with a yard. He is neutered and up to date on vaccines. If you are the special someone who can finally show Justus what it's like to be loved unconditionally, never to be abandoned or mistreated ever again, please fill out an adoption application here!

The male volunteers are my buddies and I enjoy my walks with them now that I know them.  I know I'm handsome and that makes me very attractive to potential adopters.  \n\nNot much is known about my background.  I enjoy the great outdoors and watching the birds and squirrels and nature in general.  Being a big boy, I will need a tall, secure fence.  Why am I still at AGPR?  I am VERY protective and take my guardian role very seriously.  I do not care for visitors or any of the delivery trucks.  And barking is my favorite past time if there are things moving or making noise in (or outside) of my yard.\n\nMy future family wish list?  I would love a big yard to run around in and prefer no children (I'm afraid I'll knock them over).  I'm not fond of visitors so a home with kids with visiting friends or very active and social adults might not be the right environment for me.  I also want a calm household where I can eat my meals in peace. Not sure if other household pets are going to make me happy - just not sure. I am not a Pyr for just anyone...I need big dog confident adults only.  \n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high). If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org. There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone! \n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/\n\nPlease note that we are a small regional rescue organization. We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

My name is Nala and we think I'm about 8 years old.  My previous owners were going through difficult times and had to give me up.\n\nMy back legs got a bit messed up when I was younger and they never got fixed.  The specialist said that \"they are what they are\" and there's no fix.  BUT, my cart is my best friend!  Put those wheels on and watch me go...zoom, zoom.  Squirrels, deer - watch out!\n\nI'm a flirt.  I am partial to male dogs...if they are nice and not bossy.  My buddies at AGPR tell me I am inspirational - I am \"special needs\" but don't act it.  Without the wheels, I can scoot.  With the wheels, there's no stopping me.  \n\nHoping to find a home with a family who loves my silky soft fur, my soft eyes and my \"can do\" attitude.  Oh, I will also need a ramp to the backyard if there are stairs.  But I'm worth it!\n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high).

Michael was hurting from his severe neglect and wasn't the friendliest with the shelter folks but then they didn't understand a dog not feeling good and full of fear. \nHe joined us with tumors (benign) , decaying teeth, anaemic from flea infestation, and a severe skin infection on most of his body. He could not get better till we took him to a specialist that diagnosed him with a thyroid condition.  He is now doing so much better on his medication and we have it under control. \nAs he gets older he needs a quiet home. The current foster home is too busy for our guy, and he is acting up with the other dogs.  He is a typical Eskie senior wanting a peaceful home, and to be the center of your life, your attention, and your love.\nWe are looking to either adopt this soon to be 12 year old senior, or find him a new foster home to make him happy.\nPlease email us at ohioeskierescue@outlook.com if interested on adopting or fostering.   If fostering we will go over the requirements and we will pay for all his needs.  We would prefer someone locally, near Cincinnati, Ohio or a Vet that will work with us on cost.  We will not ship him to anyone. You would have to come to Ohio so we can meet you.\n",

Thanks to our supporters, we were able to save Shane,  giving him a second chance at life! Shane is a five year old American Pit Bull Terrier/Border Collie mix. Shane makes it a point to enjoy every day to the fullest. He loves going for hikes and is always up for a new adventure. He knows basic commands and is a very smart boy. Shane would do best in an active home, with an adopter who has plenty of time to spend with him. He could be a great agility dog! Shane\u2019s currently enjoying life at the C.A.R.E. Sanctuary while waiting for his perfect home.\n\n\nAll C.A.R.E rescue dogs are fully vaccinated, heart-worm tested, spayed/neutered, and dogs are microchipped! So all you need to provide is the love.\n\nFill out an adoption application here: http://www.carerescue.org/dog-adoption\n\nOur adoption fee is a minimum $100 tax deductible donation. All donations are used for rescue and medical care of animals in need. If you don't have room to take home a pet but want to support our efforts to save animals in need, please consider making a donation. We are not city or state funded and rely solely on private donations that allow us to continue saving lives.\n\nTo learn more about us or to give a life saving donation please visit http://www.carerescue.org",

She tried everything she could before giving me up, but she finally decided the best choice was to leave me in the care of TIRR Rescue and let them find me a forever home.\n?\nAll of my original pack mates are gone, and I now hang with Deuce.  We've had a couple of other dogs in our pack, but they've been adopted, so it's just Deuce and me.  Deuce likes to think he's the boss, but we all know I'm the real alpha in this neck of the woods.  So long as everyone plays nice and no one bugs me, I get along pretty well with other dogs.  You should come see for yourself!\n\nPERSONALITY:\nPita is a sweet dog who loves to play and cuddle with her people.  She gets along well with other dogs, but she can be a bit bossy at times.  Pita loves to dig and will need a sandbox or play area where she can do so to her heart's content without ruining the yard.",

She has been diagnosed with a form of cancer and for now she is healthy and happy so it would be wonderful if she could be in a home to live some few years.\nCarly is also available for a permanent foster situation ( we would cover her medical expenses and provide food) so you have only to keep her warm and loved.\nCall us 917 533 0701 if you are interested in fostering.",

Poor girl can't catch a break, but we haven't given up hope that her forever family is out there somewhere.\n---------------------------\nSammy is a sweet girl that came from a life of neglect. When she first arrived at H4H, she was emaciated, had an old front leg break, no hair and heartworms. She has since completed heartworm treatment and a training program at Gray's K9 Academy. She is ecollar trained and knows sit, down, come, let's go and load up. She does not have an ounce of aggression, but because of the stigma attached to her breed (side note: she can be growly and rowdy when playing), we are looking for an experienced adopter for Sammy. Her adopter must be willing to do a \"go home session\" with her trainer. While Sammy has shown no agression towards kids or dogs, we feel she'd do best in a home without kids or other animals.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Savannah is a female Pit Bull Terrier mix rescued in Georgia. Our veterinary partner estimates that Savannah was born in 2016. We received the plea for help when she had been spayed at the shelter, and had somehow managed to break her spay stitches. This allowed her intestines to come through the incision site, and she was in critical condition and needed emergency surgery to repair the site. Savannah has been all fixed up and she is now doing well. Savannah is a sweet pup who is great with people of all ages. She must be the only dog in the home, and if there is another dog in the home (which we don't recommend), Savannah cannot be crated. Otherwise, Savannah does great in a crate! She currently sleeps all night in her crate and will rocket into the crate from anywhere in her foster home in response to the \"Crate Up\" command! She will also go into her open crate with a toy or snack and happily hang out there. Savannah is an excellent listener who will make a great companion! She is housetrained, knows basic commands and not destructive. She is easily overwhelmed with groups of dogs, and cannot visit dog parks. She seems to be okay on leash when there is one other dog around. Savannah will need a family who understands and accepts her issues with other dogs. If you can provide a stable, loving home for Savannah and would like to adopt her, please put your application in here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

            "description": "\"BE SURE TO WATCH MY VIDEO!\" \n\nDate of birth: 12/2014\n\n12/17/2020: Vinny is an adorable Pit Bull mix. He is 6 years old and weighs 77 lbs. He's sweet, silly and affectionate. He loves treats and dog toys, and he\u2019s a clown when he\u2019s playing with a toy! \n\n\u2022 He loves to play fetch and run around in the yard. A fenced yard would be ideal, otherwise we think he\u2019d do okay in a home where he got lots of walks and toys to play with. \n\n\u2022 He\u2019s a strong guy so needs someone who can handle his strength on walks. \n\n\u2022 He gets along with many other dogs, and loves to play in the yard with other dogs. If you have a dog we\u2019d ask you to make an appointment to bring your dog in to meet Vinny to see if they could be buddies.\n\n\u2022 Vinny was mistreated in the past. He was scared and had a lot of wounds when he first came to us, including an ear that was horribly torn up and needed surgery. He\u2019s still a little sensitive about his ear. He can be a little head shy at times if you reach for his head, or if someone waves their hand while talking he\u2019ll flinch.  He will likely need a little time to settle into a new home and become comfortable and feel safe. He\u2019s a very sensitive and sweet guy. \n\n\u2022 Vinny loves treats, and he does well meeting new people especially if they have a tasty snack to offer him! Obedience classes would be fun for him since he loves treats, and boost his confidence.  \n\n\u2022 Vinny likes kids and we think he\u2019d do well living in a home with teenagers, who understand that he is sensitive. Little kids making a lot of noise and quick movements would startle him. \n\n\u2022 Vinny needs a home without cats.\n\n\u2022 Vinny keeps his kennel clean and he\u2019s not very vocal. He has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms. He\u2019s an absolute sweetheart and silly guy who\u2019s been thru a lot and deserves a loving home. \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE: PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU. Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.  \n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.596.1000 ext. 113\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

            "description": "MEET GEORGE 4!! **Please Note: This is a courtesy post for another rescue; different adoption fees/policy apply.\n\nGeorge is a very sweet boy and will love whoever gives him his forever home! He\nenjoys being outdoors and going on hikes. He is already trained in trail etiquette\nand basic commands (sit, stay, lay down, come). He is a fast learner and would\nbenefit from further training in a home and in public.\n\nGeorge unfortunately first came to YHS on a bite quarantine. He becomes protective of his home so when a neighbor teenager entered the house unexpectedly, he bit him on the calf. Our behavior department worked with him some but never saw any of these behaviors at our shelter. He is timid in this environment but quickly learned basic commands and how to walk on a leash well. Our volunteers enjoyed taking him on a hiking trail that runs adjacent to our facility. He was adopted out but has unfortunately returned to us a second time on bite quarantine. His adopters informed us that he was a bolter and would run out the door at any opportunity. One of these bolting episodes led to him biting a teenager on a bike, again on the calf. We believe that with training and the proper adopter who will continue training and working on his various issues, he will make a very good dog.\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

            "description": "Emesto is a great little guy! Just 2-years old now, he's potty trained and has been neutered. He loves to play with my other dogs, and he is always up for a good wrestling session. Emesto is great with my cats except he likes to eat their food when he has the opportunity.\n\nHe's very shy and has some fear-based tendencies. He does not like strangers coming into his home and has nipped at visitors even though he may be already familiar with them. Because of his fear, no children is a requirement for him.\n\nEmesto has separation anxiety when we leave the house and does not do well in a crate. He tears up his bed and the plastic crate liner, so we had to come up with a different solution for him. He has many dog friends here so we know dog companionship is not an issue. We've ended up separating him in our foyer with very little in there that he can damage. He does scratch at the metal door into the garage but has done little damage other than that.\n\nA home with a fenced yard is also needed. He had excess energy he needs to run off, and he loves hanging out in the yard. So a home with a secure fence is needed\n\nHe comes when called and is quite obedient, and he's a great size at 30-pounds and is a bit of a low rider. Emesto also has these enormous ears that stand straight up most of the time. We call him Reilly after Radar O'Reilly on MASH. He's really just adorable!!\n\nHe would love to find a forever home and experience the security and happiness that comes along with that forever home.\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

            "description": "Update on Beau. After consulting with a trainer, it does appear that Beau is mostly if not all Anatolian Shepherd. He is going to need a home that has experience with livestock guarding breeds and room for him to run. He does get along well with other dogs and cats too. He will not do well with small children as he does not like when small children are loud and jumpy. He can also be protective of his home when his family is not home. He does get very attached to his family and will do best in a home without a lot of traffic and is willing to put him away when they have visitors. While he is very friendly with everyone outside the home, he is an Anatolian and bred to guard his home. Knowledge of this breed is best for this boy. Beau is pretty much a big teddy bear with his family and is very well behaved in the house. His lumps are just fatty lipomas according to the cytology and our vet says they do not need any further treatment. \n\nBeau came to us from a shelter in Alabama. He was found as a stray and no one came to claim him. He is a very big and sweet boy. He is 103 pounds and appears to be a lab, hound with maybe something else in him too. Beau has definitely lived in a home before. He is housebroken and even gets along very well with cats. He really does seem to like being with cats and he does also seem to get along very well with other dogs. We think he is about 5-7 years old and he is very much a gentle giant. He does have some weird lumps that we have the vet checking out and all his bloodwork has come back normal. So we think this maybe normal for him. He is neutered, up to date with vaccines, microchipped and heartworm and Lyme negtive. His adoption fee is $200.00. If you are interested in adopting Beau, please visit our website www.LHARinc.org go to Adopt and complete the dog adoption application.",

If Evelynn were a human she would be the little old lady hitting the teenagers in the leg with her cane as she pushed her way to the front of the line at the grocery store. Yep and we wouldn't have her any other way. Evelynn isn't great with other dogs but tolerates them for the most part. She really loves food and will sit if she smells it. She is a quirky girl and we are looking for a home that will appreciate that special side of her. To adopt go to www.libertyacresunited.com and submit an application.",

He is your typical Beagle, his nose is in everything and he LOVES food. He likes to hand out with up and curls up on the cushions on the window seat to keep an eye out on whats going on outside. Although he is 8 years old, he has lots of energy and has to be involved in everything going on. He loves our kids, and gets along great with our dogs. He has made himself at home and is settling into a nice routine. \n\nIf the animal is under the age of 2 years old, a vet reference is required which means you must own a pet or have owned a pet in your name.\n\nAdoption fee of $250 covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heart worm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

            "description": "Marla was born in May of 2018. She is a very sweet girl, working on some confidence in her new foster home. Marla is a beautiful girl that is looking for a patient, consistent owner. She is looking for a home that is able to provide her with stability to help her overcome her fears and help get her on the right track! Marla would love to live in a new home as an only dog but with the proper intro, she could potentially be OK! She is reactive to dogs in general and would need multiple visits with her new adopter. She would, however, do best in a home with no children. Young children and other high strung dogs really stress her out. Marla also needs a 6 foot fence because she can clear a 4 foot fence with no problems. With lots of structure, positive reinforcement, and the help of a trainer, we are confident that Marla will blossom into a great companion. If you think Marla would be a great addition to your family, please fill out an application to meet this sweet girl!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Marla is $300, which is TAX\nDEDUCTIBLE, and goes toward providing supportive services to animals in\nthe home, as well as the high cost of vetting our dogs in rescue. If you would\nlike to welcome Marla into your home, please begin by submitting our Adoption\nApplication. The adoptions for all of our dogs will take place in the Omaha,\nNE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship\nor deliver the dogs. If you would like to learn more about Muddy Paws\nSecond Chance Rescue, or donate to our dogs, please visit our website at\nMuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com. We invite you to visit our Facebook\nPage, and when you visit, please don't forget to Like our Facebook page so\nthat you wont miss any information about our dogs and events!",

I used to live at a home with a LOT of other dogs.  We got very little to eat and no people spent any time with us.  Now that I have been at Halfway to Home for a while, I am learning what it it like to be loved by humans and I am anxious to find a forever home!  My sisters Gretchen and Georgia got adopted and now it is my turn!  I am a little timid with strangers at first but once I get to know you I will be a wonderful companion and greet you  with love and attention and give you small kisses. With lots of love, good-quality human companionship, structure, playtime, and regular daily exercise, I will be an amazing and grateful canine companion. Once I am thoroughly settled into my new Forever home, I will benefit from positive basic obedience training to help me bond with you, and give me leash training and other obedience commands. I am good with other dogs and crate trained. For more information on me, please call Sandy at tele # 661-824-4495 (this is a land-line phone).  Please give me a chance, you will not be sorry!",

Juani was diagnosed at the shelter with erlichia (a tick-borne disease) and additionally found to be severely anemic by our vet. Hes been treated for the tick disease and neutered. Juani is a energetic and rowdy boy. He gets along with very few other dogs, very selective. He also has some anxiety based behavioral issues. He's received professional training and will need a home that continues working with him. He is very toy and food modivated! NO children or other pets. Experienced and knowledgeable dog owners ONLY. Training experience preferred. \nJuani is a special needs boy that deserves that special adopter to give him a quality life. Who knows how far Juani could go with the right person. \n\nFor more information visit us on Facebook or www.buddiesthrubullies.org or email BTBrescue@gmail.com.\n",

He stayed there over night until someone finally found him and was able to lift him off the fence.  A wonderful volunteer brought him to us and we were unsure he would ever walk again. He didn't walk for 3 days, it scared us so bad.  After the initially 3 days he started to get movement back.  It was slow going since he was so swollen and bruised.  We took him to the vet and we found a pellet in one of his back legs and that he is heartworm positive.  We had the pellet removed and he underwent an extensive neuter procedure and had his teeth cleaned.  Chuck is undergoing the slow kill method for his heartworms so that he is not put under any stress during treatment.  The wound in the picture was from hanging on the fence over night.  It took about 2.5 months to heal and close up completely.  Now Chuck in 100% healed and is living a happy life waiting for his forever family to find him.  Through all that he has been through Chuck is so loving and forgiving.  He is a bit demanding for attention. He will push his way in to get love.  He gets along well with all sizes of dogs.  He is just starting to open up and play with the dogs at his foster home.  He loves to just lay around and relax.  \n\nIf you are interested in coming to meet or adopting Chuck please visit our website at www.shannonfarmz.com and fill out an adoption application.  You won't regret meeting this sweet boy!!!",

They were terrified surrounded by all the big dogs barking and having no idea why they were suddenly homeless. They are currently in a foster home where they are doing really well. Sadly, they were not in good health when they were initially rescued. They contracted kennel cough in the short time that they were in the shelter.  They struggled to get over it.  We found out they were heartworm positive.  They have now been treated for the heartworms, spayed and up to date on vaccinations. Midnight has a heart condition that requires medication. You would never know that they are the age that their paperwork listed.  They are very playful and active girls, very sweet.  Won\u2019t you consider giving this darling pair a loving home for the time they have left.  They will brighten your home and life. They are being fostered in Decatur, IL.  Their adoption fee is $200 for the pair. Please contact Jen if interested. Email: peachesash@aol.com. Or call 630-881-8091.",

            "description": "Maple is a beautiful 3 yr old female WOLF DOG  looking for a forever home. Maple does well with other dogs and requires a large male companion dog that is outgoing to help socialize her with new people (preferably no female dogs).Maple has zero aggression towards people and has no food aggression. She is very shy and reserved at first especially towards men, which takes her longer to warm up to them. Once Maple is used to you she is a very sweet and loving dog, she just needs time and patience from her potential adopters. Maple is very strong and could use more confidence on a leash since a lot of things spook her, but once she\u2019s comfortable she would enjoy long walks. Maple requires at least a 6ft wooden privacy or chain link fence with dig guards. She is an escape artist and will jump anything smaller. Please no small pets such as cats. She is part wolf and will only be adopted to areas where wolfdogs are legal to own.\n\nIf you're interested in Maple, please read our adoption requirements first at; http://www.howlingwoods.org/adopt_a_wolf_adoption_requirements.html\n\nthen submit an application at; http://www.howlingwoods.org/wolf_adoption_adopt_a_wolf_application.php\n\nor contact us by calling (732) 534-5745\n\nDo not inquire about or apply for Maple if you live in any the following States: Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine. Wolfdogs are illegal to possess in these States.",

I would love to accompany you everywhere you go from the hardware store to walks around the neighborhood to short hikes in the hills. I love car rides and am so well behaved while riding along. Everyone I encounter stops to visit because I'm so friendly. I know all my basic commands, house-trained, walk well on a leash and am crate trained. Beware, I LOVE to snuggle!!! I only bark to say hello and believe it or not, I won't bother you at meal time. I'm super gentle when I get yummy treats. I am a little selfish when it comes to sharing my human with other dogs; best if I am the only canine you dote on. Even at 7 years young I am full of good energy, with a lot of life left to live and only love to give. I will be your ultimate companion! 1/31/21 12:11 PM",

This girl is a little of everything! American Staffordshire, Chow Chow, Labrador Retriever, Great Pyrenees and a bunch of other stuff all thrown in. Resulting in one gorgeous girl. She\u2019s been searching for her forever home for way too long! How has no one scooped her up?\n\nThis girl LOVES  people and wants nothing more than to please them. Kisses? - she\u2019s got plenty to share with friends and strangers alike. Toys? - she loves playing for hours. House-trained? - absolutely, she\u2019s a real little lady in the house.\n\nOnly potential caveat is that Maya doesn\u2019t love living with other pets. She needs to be the one and only in your heart and home. This means no dogs or cats. You can understand that, can\u2019t you? Sometimes quality is more important than quantity!\n\nMaya is UTD on everything, spayed, microchipped and looking for her permanent residence!

Marbles seems to be an Australian Cattle Dog, but his short, flat coat and head shape suggests some Lab DNA.\n\nAfter his owners gave up on him, Marbles was left in a Virginia shelter without a strong adoption program. His options became tragically limited, so we invited him to Connecticut. Clearly, Marbles is is a double dose of working dog, so he definitely needs an active lifestyle and a job. Herders are hardwired to work, and if his adopters do not give Marbles a job, he will practice his herding skills within the household. A bored, frustrated herding dog is a recipe for mayhem.\n\nExercise and obedience training are the keys to managing the Herding breeds. Marbles is a high-energy dog, who would make a great running, walking or hiking partner. He's built for speed, but will adjust his pace to suit his handler. He needs at least three brisk daily leash walks, in addition to focused playtime. Adopters can increase the intensity of a walk by outfitting Marbles with a dog backpack, loaded with water, and a collapsable bowl. At each rest and water stop, Marbles will feel like he's got a job and will be quite proud of himself.\n\nObedience training is essential to meeting the needs of a Herding dog. Marbles already knows all of his basic obedience commands, and has passed many of his Canine Good Citizenship tests. Structure and obedience work go a long way in providing him the mental and physical challenges that he needs. Adopters should be prepared to troubleshoot things that come up with Marbles, as he transitions to a new environment.\n\nMarbles is best suited to an active adult home, with a dog savvy single or couple, who have the time and energy to give him his daily exercise. Tranquility and calm suit Marbles best. In a chaotic, hectic environment he becomes anxious and demonstrates herding behavior in order to maintain social order. In a calm environment, Marbles relaxes and enjoys quiet time with his people. Kids and cats may provide too much stimulation, but Marbles could easily join a multi-dog home, with an energy compatible, well socialized dog.\n\nMarbles has good house manners and is house trained and crate trained, although adopters should expect to troubleshoot a few accidents during his transition to a new routine. He is in excellent health, has been neutered. He has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus), He has been boostered as needed. He has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Hi, my name is Sassy and I'm ready for my forever home. My first family abandoned me when I was a baby, so I don't like being left alone. I'm very energetic, active, curious, lovable, sensitive and absolutely adorable. I'm a smart girl, who knows some basics obedience. However, obedience classes would really be a good idea for me and my new family. I love having canine brothers and sisters to play with. Right now, I have three sisters and a brother. I'm the youngest, but I'm bigger than everybody. We have a blast running, wrestling, and chasing toys during the day. At night, we cuddle up and take a short break from the excitement. I've never had any human brothers or sisters, but I'm sure I'd like them as long as they are older and know the proper way to play with me. I DON'T like my tail or ears pulled, and please don't touch my behind. Did I mention I don't like to be left alone? I get bored quickly, and I just might get into something I shouldn't. So, it's best to keep an eye on me, and crate me when no one is home. Afterall, I'm still a kid and I'm still learning. Please be patient with me, and I'll grow up to be the best dog ever. I don't care much for being hugged, but I like giving hugs. If you're looking for a special little girl, who will love you unconditionally and will fit right in with your other doggies, I just might be that girl. Don't forget to check out all of my gorgeous photos and my amazing video.\n\nPlease contact\napp@aarfhouston.org\nfor more information about this dog.\n\nYou can apply online by clicking on\n\nApplication\n\n. Once your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue!\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

She is now about 2 yrs old, about 65lbs and on a diet ! She is great with people, but can be a picky with her dog friends. She's generally well-mannered, but can be a handful when she gets excited. She needs to be able to exercise in a fenced yard and needs good obedience training. She is a quick learner and very treat motivated. She also needs a patient, 'pit' experienced person to help her become the excellent dog she can be. Please contact Dee at K9rescueva@gmail.com with questions and to schedule a meeting at the next adoption event.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events.

            "description": "Zeke is a handsome Rotti/Lab mix who is looking for a home of his own after his owner sadly passed away. He is approximately 6.5 years old and a big strong boy at just under 80 lbs. This canine gentleman is house trained, well behaved in the home, does not mind being left alone, walks well on a leash and has a good understanding of basic commands. Zeke is gentle, cuddly and super affectionate with his people but true to his breed, can be territorial when strangers enter his home or yard; he can be nervous of people when he first meets them but warms up quickly and once he knows you he will greet you like a long-lost friend! A home that has experience with these guardian breed traits would be ideal for him. Zeke also needs some work on handling, in particular his feet and at the vet's, and requires a patient and knowledgeable owner who will continue the work his foster home has been doing to desensitize him, using only positive methods since he does not respond well to harsh corrections. This special boy has so much potential and is going to make a great addition to the right family. At this time we are looking for an adult family who have same (or similar) breed experience where he will be the only animal in the home.  Due to some behavioral issues Zeke requires a fully fenced backyard and is not suitable for condo/apartment living.",

She was finally caught in a humane trap and taken in and spayed to stop unwanted litters of pups.  She was brought into the humane society where she spent a few months in recovery from her spay that turned out to be rough on her.  There she got hands on with kind people to pet on her and make her feel comfortable around humans again.  She is ready to go into a home where she will need some patience person to be kind to her and show her the world isn\u2019t so bad.  She needs a fenced yard due to the fact she spent so much time on the run.  She likes kids so house with older children would make her happy.  She is house broke and looking for that place to call home.  She is heartworm negative and we want her to stay that way so any interested adopter must have a good vet reference with understanding the importance of heartworm prevention. .",

Lolli has had some issues with regurgitation, and has undergone extensive testing while in rescue so we could get to the bottom of her issues. Turns out she has Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD), so Lollipop eats a special diet and is held upright after eating to help her to keep her food down. Lollipop has been living quite the pampered life with her foster parents Barbara and Drew, where Barbara spends time each day taking great care of Lolli.\n\nADOPTION INFO:  Lollipop's adoption fee is $375.00, which includes all vaccinations, surgery, spay, microchipping and other medical care received while in rescue. If you would like to adopt Lollipop or any of our other rescues, please complete an application on our website at:  www.houstonbostonrescue.org\n\nFACEBOOK:  Be sure to keep up with all of our new arrivals and rescue activities on our Facebook page:   Facebook.com/BostonTerrierRescue\n\nSPONSOR A RESCUE: If you would like to sponsor Lollipop or any of our other rescues, please go to our website to find out how you can help:  www.houstonbostonrescue.org",

He is a fun loving, curious, and energetic boy.  He is very smart and knows his basic commands.  He will need work on house training as do most dogs who've lived in the shelter for an extended period of time.  Louie does want to please but his, \"Hey, look a squirrel\" instinct kicks in and sometimes he just can't ignore it!  He walks very strongly on a leash but he does have good manners.  He shouldn't go to a home with small children. However, older children who understand how to respect a dog are fine.   \n\nFor more information, please contact Isle of Wight County Animal Services at 757-365-6318.",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nMeet Kenny...a 1-2 year old beagle mix (long body, low rider with an underbite).\u00a0 Kenny was surrendered by a family who was moving, and he was terribly frightened in the shelter.\u00a0 Oftentimes a frightened dog in the shelter relaxes in home foster care, but Kenny took longer than most and would run and hide.\u00a0 We have been celebrating his progress in baby steps.\u00a0 He is finally looking happy and alert, tolerating eye contact, and wagging his tail.\u00a0 He takes his cues from the other dogs, and he now runs up to his foster mom with the pack to greet her and touches his nose to her hand.\u00a0 He understands \u201ckennel up\u201d for meal time and enters his crate on his own with encouragement (the edible kind).\u00a0 He loves treats and is just starting to take them by hand.\u00a0 Kenny is conflicted about touch, as he is not keen to be handled, yet he seems to enjoy a little bit of scratching and petting now when he is in his crate.\u00a0 He does not go outside yet, as he is a very high flight risk, and he is making nice progress with pad training.\u00a0 True to his breed, Kenny can be vocal, so he is not an apartment dog.\u00a0 He is a delightful boy who needs a patient, understanding, experienced adopter who is willing to meet him where he is at now.\u00a0 He would thrive in a quieter environment with at least one other dog companion and needs a fenced in yard. \u00a0\n\nAdoption fee is $350.00 + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact:  Sara - 651-260-3774 or sara.fostermom@gmail.com\n\nThis dog will not be at our adoption event at the Woodbury PetSmart on Saturday from 11-2, so contact his foster to learn more. \n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

I doubt this girl is much past her first birthday and the fact that she is heart worm positive just blows my mind! ETPBR will treat her HWs prior to finalizing her adoption. Shayla is spayed and vaccinated We will micro chip her in the next few days. She loves other dogs and people. She needs some manners and we will work on that... Meanwhile Shayla needs a foster home to help us get her thru her heart worm treatment. If that foster home were to be a foster to adopt home...well all the better. If you have room in your heart and home for this clown, please fill out the on-line application at www.etnpitbullrescue.orgEast TN Pit Bull Rescue adopts out to companion homes only. Adoptions require an application that is verified, a meeting that includes ALL members of the household, a home visit, and a trial period. We do not place our dogs in homes with unaltered pets or homes that have pets but do not have a vet. All of our dogs are placed as inside pets, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, vaccinations current, and HW- or treated within the last 6 months for heart worms by our vet. Adoption fees start at $150 for adults and $200 for pups. If you are interested in offering this pet a responsible and loving home, please fill out the on-line application at www.etnpitbullrescue.org.

They are great with people and most other dogs. They love to be with people, taking walks, relaxing, chewing their bones. These two guys adore each other, sleep together, play together, were found as strays together...therefore we will keep them together! Both are house trained, have great manners and have a few tricks to show off. Their ages are estimated at 6-7 years old. They would do best in a home without very young children (under 10). They are NOT feline friendly. \nPlease consider this wonderful pair of bonded boys! You won\u2019t regret adding them to your family!!!\nTheir combined adoption fee is $250. They have been neutered, microchipped, heart worm/Lyme tested (-). Included in their adoption fee is 6 weeks of obedience training!!\nThey are ready to pack their bags and move into their forever home! Please email hopeadoptme@gmail.com to request an application for them!",

            "description": "Shelby is believed to be a Labrador-Pittie mix, which is honestly a dream combination; the fun of a Labrador and the smushy cuddles of a pitty! Her webbed paws are hilariously big for her body, and she lives for a summer swim! Shelby is the type of dog that you\u2019ll need an extra 5 minutes with. While we don\u2019t know the details of her past, we do know that she had enough experiences with NC\u2019s finest to distrust humans. Shelby might initially bark or do a little nervous jig, but this sweet girl emerges in just a few minutes and she is worth the wait!\n\nNow that we\u2019ve tried to sell you on Shelby, it\u2019s YOUR turn to sell yourself TO Shelby. Shelby will need three or more of the following adopter qualities before she unpacks her bags and calls it home:\n1) Seven bedroom mansion by the lake, complete with pool and dock for optimal swimming opportunity (okay, a walk to the river or lake will also do...we guess)\n2) Netflix subscription. Shelby is currently rewatching The Office for the 8th time\n3) Comfy bed to allow for optimal cuddles\n4) TREATS. All of the treats.\n5) A canine companion for company and cardio (Wrestlemania ??)\n6) A human with ideal arm strength for belly scratches and leg strength for those lake walks (see item \n7) Toys. We\u2019re talking squeaky, fluffy, rope, rubber, whatever!\n \n\nShelby\u2019s quote: \u201cForever is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning. Help me find my forever.\u201d\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Shelby, please visit www.pincdogrescue.com/adopt and submit an adoption application. You will also find our adoption process listed on that page.",

Although he is getting older, not much has changed in his energy department and as you can see by his new pics, he doesn't look any older.  His foster mom says he still acts as if he is 6.  He did just start some new medicine though.  It's called Proin.  Seems Pacino is having trouble tinkling when he is sleeping.  The vet is trying this to see if will help.  Foster mom is noticing that his eyesight and hearing are lacking a little, but that happens to everyone with age.\n\nHe also takes Phenobarbital for seizures and, thankfully, hasn't had any seizures since he's been on the medicine.  He takes 1 15 mg pill twice daily.\n\nHe doesn't really play with any of the other dogs in his foster home.  He does love car rides and going for walks.  He loves breakfast and supper time and is a very fast eater\n\nOther than that, Pacino is a happy, healthy boy and if you ask him, he has many years left.  Want to give an older guy a happy home?  Pacino loves everyone and even though he loves foster mom, he wouldn't mind changing addresses if it would give him a last name.\n\n7/15/19 - Pacino is a sweetheart of a guy.  He definitely doesn't act, look or feel his age.  The guy seems more like 7 years old.  He is a bigger, longer bodied boy, but still small enough to pick up and love.  He loves giving kisses and is very in tune with his people.  Since his bladder stone surgery, he eats a prescription diet.  If there are other pups in the home, Pacino would have to be put up to eat since he is food aggressive with other dogs.  We aren't sure where this stemmed from, but it is an easy fix, just put in a room to eat or a crate.  If there aren't any other dogs in the home, which Pacino would absolutely love, there is no need to put him up while eating.  He is fine with the other dogs all other times, so could co-exist or be the only big baby.  We have just noticed a growth on Pacino's leg by his front left shoulder, and will be getting it checked out and removed soon, along with a tiny sty on the inside of his bottom eyelid.  Pacino would be a great addition to a laid back home with or without dogs where he can be loved and give love.\n\n6/21/19 - Pacino has been in his foster home for a while now and wants to give everyone an update.  You would not be able to guess his age if you met him because he acts so young at heart and has energy to burn.  His legs are like springs and he can bounce very high.  He needs a big secure yard to run and play in and owners that can watch him when the front door is open since he is very curious and tempted to run.  The perfect home for Pacino would be where he could be the only pup or with one other calm dog since he loves getting a lot of attention.  He does have Napoleon tendencies at feeding time, so he eats separately and isn\u2019t let out until everyone is finished so as not to have any fights.\n\nPlease give Pacino a chance at a home where he is the main man and he will not disappoint you.\n\n3/20/19 - Now since I am feeling better, foster mom said that it is time for me to tell the world about myself.  Well, my name is Pacino, as in Al Pacino.  My previous mom could not keep me any longer due to life changes, so my new foster mom stepped in to give me a place to call my own until she could find me my real home.  Shortly after coming to live with her, she realized I had bladder stones and needed immediate surgery.  That was done and now I feel so much better.  I will have to stay on a prescription diet food (Royal Canin Urinary SO hard food) from now on so they won\u2019t return, but it\u2019s fine because I like my new food.  \n\nI eat twice daily and need to eat alone.  I tend to be a bit of a terminator if another dog comes around while I am trying to enjoy by kibble.  So, it\u2019s much easier if I just eat alone and stay up until all the other furbabies are finished eating.\n\nI\u2019m ok around children as long as they are older and don\u2019t get too chaotic or want to pull on my ears or tail.  And I do like to give the humans, old or young, kisses.\nI would love to sleep in bed with my humans and I promise I will not take up too much of the bed or covers.\n\nI get very attached to my humans and love getting and giving attention.  I can also be a great coach potato if you want to snuggle and cuddle for some movies.  I also like playing with toys.  My potty training is coming along, and I will use pee pads, but foster mom still catches me marking at times.  So, I\u2019m not perfect.\n\nI will bark when I\u2019m excite or when the other dogs bark, it isn\u2019t crazy obsessive.  I\u2019m a little timid around the vacuum cleaner but getting more used to it.  I have very strong legs and can jump on the furniture to be with you.\n\nI do have terrier in me, so I will have to be put up or picked up if someone is at the door because I will take that opportunity to run off.  The unknown just looks so exciting.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind another doggy to play with, but they shouldn\u2019t be too rough because I can get offended easily.  I might be 10 years old, but I don\u2019t know it and I have energy to play.  That doesn\u2019t mean that I can turn right around and nap or cuddle with my humans.\n\nI just an all-around great boy that is in the prime of my life.  I\u2019m up for a walk, a nap or basically whatever you want.  First, you have to apply to adopt me and then we can discuss adventures.\n\n2/24/19 - Thanks to all of you, Pacino had his bladder stone surgery Friday and is doing well.  We are so happy for this little man.  His foster mom picked him up yesterday and its as if he never had surgery.  It's amazing what these babies can endure.  He will have a recheck in about a week to have a urinalysis and see if all is well, then schedule his dental and he will get a microchip at that time.  Pacino said to tell everyone thank you and we will be posting a bio soon to tell about his personality very soon.\n\n2/14/19 - Pacino needs immediate surgery because he is in need of surgery.  He has 1 large bladder stone in his bladder.  Please consider donating to Pacino so we can get him comfortable.  He was surrendered by his owner because she did not have time for him.  He is in a foster home now and ready to have surgery and start feeling better.  PLEASE HELP US HELP PACINO!!!\n\n",

DOB 1/1/2016), wgt 15.5 lbs., neutered, micro-chipped, rabies, heartworm tested, distemper, and wormed. \n\nMy past is unknown. When I was rescued from the streets, I suffered from a degenerative retinal disease that was progressive, rendering me blind, therefore, both my eyes were surgically removed in February 2019. I am also hard of hearing but can hear loud sounds. I have adapted well to my blindness. I am a lover, a character with so much love and life to offer you. I love tummy rubs, snuggling, cuddling with you in bed, showering your face with kisses, and walks on a leash. I can navigate a house exceptionally well and can learn the layout of a new home really fast! I can get up on a couch or chair by myself but my favorite place to chill is in a dog bed. I am such a happy little boy nothing can stop me from learning new things. I get along well in my foster home with a cat and three other dogs.\n\nI need a calm home and don't do well with young children that do not understand that I am blind and who may repeatedly and/or unexpectedly grab at me. This stresses me out and gives me anxiety.  I also require minimal time alone. If not in a secure, fenced outdoor area, I will need to be leashed and have my person with me for guidance.\n\nMy adoption fee $250.00\nFor information about me you can email my foster mom directly at cacollins46@gmail.com. To fill out a pre-adopt application please cut and paste the following URL, https://tinyurl/com/LETS-PRE-ADOPT-APP into your browser.  Potential adopters will be contacted to arrange a meet and greet at Pet Supplies Plus 2649 E. Grand River, Howell, MI.\n\nNo out of state adoptions",
