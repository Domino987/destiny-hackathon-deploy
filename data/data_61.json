            "description": "*Name: Maddox\n*Age: 2 years\n*Current Weight: 37 lbs\n*Health: up to date on required vaccinations, neutered, microchipped, Heartworm+\n\nMaddox is a wonderful pup! He wants to get all the love - and he will give all his love right back!\u00a0\n\nMaddox loves going for walks and exploring the world. He has fun running circles in the yard and enjoys a good play session. He is very patient with kids, and enjoys hanging out with them. In the evenings, he is part of the family hanging out on the sofa and watching TV.\u00a0\n\nHe is a super engaging pup with a great little personality - he makes us laugh often. His tail wags often, but when he\u2019s super excited, his whole body wags. Maddox will be a bit nervous the first couple of weeks, but will soon settle in and be a wonderful, loving companion.\n\nMaddox is heartworm positive and started his treatment in November. He will come with 6 months of Heartguard. \n\nTo apply to adopt Maddox, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records. Remember, most of the time rescues are all just taking our best guess with breeds!\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

            "description": "Hi world! My name is Zoro! I'm 1.5 years old, 65 lbs, and a Boxer mix who recently arrived in Wisconsin from Oklahoma! I'm friendly, gentle, goofy, and I love to go for walks and play, but I also love to snuggle up on the couch for cuddling and napping.\n\nI love to be outside, and I walk with a loose-leash most of the time! I'm usually quiet when I'm walking, and mostly like to concentrate on sniffing! When I see other dogs on walks, I sometimes get excited, but I don't usually need to say hello to them. After I go on my morning walk, I definitely need to take a tap to recuperate! I like relaxing and napping just as much as I like my outside time.\n\nI love playing with toys, too! I play by myself a lot, but I like when my foster mom plays fetch with me, too. My foster mom says I'm a goofball when I play with toys and that's when my silly personality really comes out. \n\nI also just love meeting people! I'm a very friendly dog and I've gotten along with all of the humans I\u2019ve met! I like being pet and being near people a lot. I\u2019m also working on learning to be alone, too. Right now, it\u2019s best that I stay in my kennel while people are gone. I go in there easily and I\u2019m comfortable and cozy in there. \n\nI'm still adapting to living life inside of a home. There are a lot of new noises and people, and sometimes that scares me a bit. When I'm scared, I pace around my house and whine to show you that there's something making me uncomfortable. I need a future forever family who has patience to help me learn that the world isn't scary, and slowly introduce me to new things. I shouldn\u2019t be in a home with a cat, but I get along with other dogs and many people!\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website-?www.luckymuttsrescue.org?and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application. We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you,please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

            "description": "ADOPT ME ONLINE: https://ophrescue.org/dogs/10302\n\nBiscayne is a 2-year-old, 33-pound cattle dog mix that is deep down a big teddy bear. He loves to cuddle up in bed and take up lots of space! Belly scratches are his favorite and he will let you know when he wants more. He would do best in an area with lots of space to run and easy access to an area to go to the bathroom. He is a bit shy of other dogs and vocal when he sees others he doesnt know. \n\nHe knows to sit and even scratches at the door for you when he needs to go out, so listen carefully! Biscayne is also an energetic dog and could run on and on but will love to cuddle up with you on the couch. He is also dealing with a bit of separation anxiety when left alone or when his favorite person leaves but is just out of love. If you have any other questions let me know!\nTo adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org \nOperation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home.",

After a jog, he is super chill for the rest of the day. He will try to chase cats, squirrels and big birds, but is easily distracted when I use his harness and voice. He will growl at other dogs when they come too close, so likely will need a lot of training, or, better, be in a home with no other dogs or cats.\n\nHe sure acts very youthful and is wonderfully lively for his age of 10. Potty trained, quiet and sleeps well at night. He was a bit fearful of us at first, but after a few weeks of cuddles and love, he comes bounding up to us now when we get home. He has been friendly to all of our family and to kind passers by who want to pet him. We will miss him! He is a true love!!\n\nA little bit about Tali, he came to Hopalong from a hoarding case, he lived most of his life in a crate. He had horrible skin, dental and other issues. He is all healthy now and happy! After living several years without much socialization we hope he finds the best home.\n\n*Needs to be in a home with no dog or cat*\n\n** WANT MORE INFO OR THINKING OF ADOPTING THIS PET? **\n\nFor a QUICK RESPONSE go to -- WWW.HOPALONG.ORG -- and complete an adoption application. It is not a commitment to adopt, it just begins the process and shows interest in a particular animal. Someone will contact you by phone or email within 2 full business days to interview you or inform you on the status of your application.",

            "description": "Sweet Gypsy!  She weighs just under 40 lbs and is approx 1.5 years old.  She was saved from a shelter where she was brought in with her litter of puppies.  We have done a DNA on her and she is basically part American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bull Dog with small percentage of Jack Russell Terrier. Gypsy was apparently never socialized with people and is very very cautious and timid.  She has been with one of our fosters since late October and has slowly been coming out of her shell.  This is what we have learned about Gypsy:  She most definitely needs a social, playful dog in the household.  A fenced in yard is a must.  She loves ......loves to play outside.  When she comes back in the house she, for the most part, likes to stay in her \u201csafe spot\u201d whether its a doggy bed or a crate.  She is housebroken if kept on a schedule.  A good routine is best for Gypsy.  Once she got to know her foster, she does follow her around the house and now gets very excited to see her when she comes home from work and has to be acknowledged and petted right away.  Gypsy at this time cannot be leashed walked.  We are going to insist that she be adopted locally within the Richmond/Chesterfield area.\n\nWe do have some videos of her playing with her canine buddy at her foster home.  Serious inquiries only.  Potential adopter needs to understand she will take lots of time and patience in her new home.  No children under 16 years old please. \n\nGypsy is a wonderful, beautiful, very sweet girl but  we do not feel she will never be a lap dog but you never know.  We want a serious adopter that will spend lots of time letting her chase balls outside and playing with another dog.   Once she comes inside, she is very quiet and content. \n \nApproved application and adoption fee of $225.  She is updated on vaccinations, heartworm negative, on hw and flea preventative, spayed and microchipped.\n\nYou can contact Pam Danford @ 804-229-4043 for more information about Gypsy.",

He's alert and smart, and protective of his home, so if something is fishy he'll let you know. He's happy to be in the company of his foster mom and kids, but he'll scurry into hiding when the dad is walking around. He loves to play with his foster sister Joy and share a bed with her. He gets pretty worked up when he sees another dog so we haven't walked him on the street very much. \n\n** WANT MORE INFO OR THINKING OF ADOPTING THIS PET? **\n\nFor a QUICK RESPONSE go to -- WWW.HOPALONG.ORG -- and complete an adoption application. It is not a commitment to adopt, it just begins the process and shows interest in a particular animal. Someone will contact you by phone or email within 2 full business days to interview you or inform you on the status of your application.",

Porkchop gets along with other dogs his size, still likes to play like a pup But his favorite thing is to snuggle with his human. Porkchop found himself landing at the county shelter as a stray and unfortunately spent a whole year there waiting for his forever. During his time there he was the donor for a blood transfusion that saved 2 puppies. Porkchop is now thriving in a foster home but would love a home to call his own. Porkchop does have heartworm but he is on a monthly medication under Vet supervision. Porkchop will come with a year supply of his monthly medication. \nIf interested in meeting Porkchop please fill out an application at fureverfriendz.org\nOwning your own home is a requirement! \nPorkchop's adoption fee is $250 which includes his neuter, microchip, vaccines and heartworm medication.",

She is medium sized, about 40 lbs. She is not house trained, but does well in a crate.  She is good with most other dogs.  She can be stubborn and snappy when you want her to do something she doesn't want to do, like go out to potty when it's cold.  She needs someone who has had heelers before and knows their quirks and personality, and won't let her get away with being the boss.  She has great inside manners.\n\nRoo is looking for a forever family to call her own. Her adoption fee is $200, which includes spay surgery and vaccinations (parvo/distemper and rabies.)

'  Those are some of the glowing descriptions provided by my foster family.  What more needs to be said!?\n\nWell, there is more.  My fosters report that I am good on the leash, great with their teenagers and I seem to be house trained.  I am generally well behaved (Though I did steal bacon off the table one time \u2013 but really . . .  bacon within reach.  Can you blame me?).  I love pets and cuddles.  I know sit and paw, and I catch treats like a champ.  Who knows what else you can teach me!  I could also likely live with the right doggie sibling.\n\nPrior to PAC, I was found as a stray in Florida, and no one came to claim me.   I sure act like I have known family home life.  Will you be the one to provide it for me forever?\n\n\u2018Nuff said.  Please come check me out.  Some details:\n\nI'm about 6 years old, around 58 pounds, microchipped, spayed and up to date on my vaccinations. \n\nSo, if you are interested in more information about me and/or would like to set up a meeting with me, please send a completed adoption profile (found here - https://providenceac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Adoption-Profile.pdf) to foster@providenceac.org today!\n\nXOXO \u2013 Reba\n\n\nP.S. Someone is so excited for me to find my fur-ever home, that they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! Woohoo!!\" \n\n___\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating!

I'm a smaller terrier mix who is a tawny-golden-hazel color, with two white socks on my front feet. I'm a looker! But here's the thing -- I need a very experienced owner, one familiar with my breed. No first-time dog owners for me. And I just cannot live with cats, critters, other dogs, or children under 12 years old. That's a lot of restrictions, I know! But I'll be all the dog  you'll need. I'm curious, athletic, and eager to learn. I arrived here as a stray, and it's clear I haven't been given a chance to be a good girl. A skilled owner, plenty of exercise, and ongoing obedience classes could be great for me.\n\n\n",

            "description": "What is your name?\n\nI\u2019m Goulash, but they like to call me GOO!\n\nHow old are you?\n\nI am right about a year old now (as of January, 2021).\n\nWhat do you look like?\n\nI\u2019m about 45 pounds, have cropped ears, and I\u2019m a blue-ish fawn color!\n\nWhat do you like to eat?\n\nPretty much anything. I don\u2019t really get a sensitive belly.\n\nWhat kind of personality do you have?\n\nI am pretty easy going! I love chewing on bones, playing inside, and being near my people! Cuddling is great, too.\n\nDescribe your perfect day\n\nA nice walk in the am, followed by a nap on my bed and some treat training in the afternoon! Maybe a trip to the pet store?\n\nWhat is your favorite toy?\n\nBALLS! Durable rubber balls and water buffalo horns are the best!\n\nDo you know any tricks?\n\nUm\u2026 I can sit, look handsome, and stay for a few seconds for you to catch a picture!\n\nWhat scares you?\n\nI don\u2019t like a lot of loud voices or physical roughhousing, but I\u2019m not necessarily scared. I just tend to avoid those moments.\n\nDo you like cats?\n\nThey are really interesting! My foster home has some and I have been learning all about leaving them alone and I\u2019m doing really well! I just want to play, but mostly understand that they don\u2019t want to play with me.\n\nDo you have any doggie best friends?\n\nNo, I\u2019m not allowed to have doggie best friends because I don\u2019t like to share.\n\nIf you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be?\n\nOn. The. Couch.\n\nHow is your health?\n\nI\u2019m pretty good now! When I came to EC I had some colon issues and a UTI but I am long past them now! I have had surgery to repair these issues and I\u2019m doing awesome! I was just neutered in January 2021, too.\n\nHow long have you lived in your foster home?\n\nI\u2019ve been with a member of Even Chance since around October 2020\n\nWho do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion?\n\nMy foster mom for sure! The kitties are ok, though. ?\n\nWhere do you hang out when you are home alone?\n\nI always hang out in my crate when there aren\u2019t any people home.\n\nWhere do you sleep?\n\nI always sleep in my crate at night, but while my family is home, I will lay on my bed or snuggle on the couch.\n\nWhat do you love about your foster family?\n\nI love that my foster family is so dedicated to meeting all my needs. I am grateful that Even Chance rescued me!\n\nWhat was life like before you were rescued by Even Chance and brought into the welcoming arms of your foster parents?\n\nI was surrendered to a shelter because my first home couldn\u2019t meet my medical (colon) needs.\n\nEven Chance does not operate on a first come, first serve basis. In most cases we have already decided the type of home and owner we want for our dogs. These opinions are based on the temperament tests we perform prior to accepting the dog into our program and the behaviors the dogs display as they spend time in our homes. Our agency reserves the right to deny acceptance of any dog to an owner who we feel the lifestyle does not match that of the dog. We are in no way judging you or your lifestyle; we simply want to put our dogs in the best living situation possible. We take very seriously the decision we make when it comes to placing one of our dogs in a forever home. If I sound like the perfect pit bull for you and your family and you are interested in giving me a forever home, do not hesitate! Please fill out an application here and my foster family will contact you to schedule an in-person meet and greet. We look forward to meeting any and all interested applicants.",

Which is probably how he found himself lost and almost drown in a water filtration plant in rural Louisiana. Thank goodness he was found when the worker came in that morning or he wouldn't have made it much longer. He couldn't get out by himself. He was seen by the vet and he wasn't injured and the nasty water didn't hurt him. \n\nThis boy will need a secured fenced in yard to be able to run and play in. He will need a family to help teach him some manners and that jumping isn't appropriate. He is learning very quickly and is definitely treat motivated. He is scheduled to be neutered in 2 weeks. He is up to date on shots, rabies, dewormer, on heartworm prevention, and microchipped. To adopt Bayou apply at CanineHavenRescue.org under available adoption tab. His adoption fee is $350",

            "description": "Otis is a wonderful happy pup born Feb. 2020 to a stray momma in Tyler, TX. They went to another rescue for a bit but ended up here when the other rescue had too many dogs to\ncare for.\n\nOtis is energetic and loves to play, but when you're done playing, he will climb into your lap to cuddle. He's a total sweetheart. He thinks he's a lap dog - it's pretty cute. This little guy is has the most soulful eyes. He is a real heart stealer! Otis has done great with children and does really well with the other dogs in his playgroup. Otis is submissive with other dogs, but just wants to play and be near them. He would do well with a doggie companion in his forever home. We think Otis would do best in a home with a yard, as we do not think apartment life would suit him. He would love to have a big yard to run around and play fetch with you. Otis takes anxiety medication daily to make him feel less nervous and more comfortable. The medication is really no big deal. It's extremely inexpensive, readily available, and makes Otis feel happy and well-adjusted. He can still be a little nervous with new people and places(which is understandable, given his background), so he will need a patient adopter that will allow him adequate time to decompress and adjust to his surroundings.",

My family thinks I'm about 2 years old in human years, but still have some puppy in me so who knows! I'm 48 pounds, black and tan and was neutered in December, which gave me lots of excuses for cuddles. I still have a little growing to do, but I'm still a puppy at heart! I'm still learning commands, but I'm a very quick learner and have basic manners down (even though I'm still learning how to play gentle). I'm house-broken, crate-trained, and very conscious of the rules of the house (no furniture for me unless you tell me!). I'm calm in the car since I know I'll be on my way for an adventure, sometimes I'll even fall asleep for the ride! Though I act tough at first, I like meeting new people and will bond quickly with my family! Everyone always tells my mom how handsome I am and how funny I am when I try to tell them thank you (guess no one speaks dog)! I love playing with other dogs (big and small) and have met a few kids and a cat, but I'm not 100% sure about them just yet. Once I get used to a space and people, I am a great companion and will follow you anywhere! Ideally, I want a backyard with a buddy to play with. My mom takes me on walks, but nothing compares to herding friends at the dog park or getting cuddles before a nap! If you think you can offer me my furever home, please contact your adoption coordinator. If you do not have an adoption coordinator, please complete an adoption application at https://freedomgermanshepherdrescue.org I am being fostered in Wilmington.",

No family to take care of her, We gladly took her into the Dog Days family.\n\nOnce in foster care we realized she was not properly socialized with other dogs. She simply does not know how to interact appropriately with other dogs.\n\nWe have also learned she is fun, spunky, energetic, loves to snuggle or play with toys/chew bones.\n\nWe are looking for a place for this senior to lay her head and be spoiled for the rest of her years. A place where she can be queen of the castle as an only pet.\n\nLilly is about 40 lbs She walks well on leash. Lilly is crate trained and house trained.\n\nAdoption fee $ 150 includes spay/neuter, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. Lily had a dental completed in November 2020. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting fill out an application at https://www.petstablished.com/pets/public/906736 by clicking on the adopt button.\n\n \n\nDog Days in a small, foster based Rescue based out of Kennesaw, Ga.\n\nWe have some amazing babies waiting for their forever families to find them. All of our babies are spayed/neutered, current on vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative or have been treated for heartworm.\n\nDue to Covid-19 we are not holding our normal Petco Adoption Days. Instead we are scheduling one on one meet and greets with approved applicants.\n\nIf you see a dog you are interested Please fill out an application. Once approved we will schedule a meet and greet with the dog/dogs you are interested in. Meet a greets are held outside (when the weather permits) by appointment only and with a limited number of people with everyone wearing masks.\n\nWe are unable to process out of state adoptions at this time",

He loves water, playing fetch and getting all the attention!  \n\nChief was found on Thanksgiving and looking for that special family to call his own.  \n\nHe can be a chewer if left alone, some continued training is recommended for him to become an his best self!  He is very smart and eager to learn.  \n\nOlder children recommended because of his size.  He doesn't know how big he is quite yet.  :)   He is good with other large dogs.\n\nChief will need to be in a home with a yard and will do best with a lot of exercise.  \n\n*******If you would like to meet sweet Chief, please email spwheels1@gmail.com, for an adoption application. \n",

I absolutely love being with my humans at all times, so my ideal furever home is where someone that's home the majority of the time or can take him with them. I am a brilliant dude who knows \"sit\" and \"shake\" and takes treats gently.

He would do best with a doggy playmate of similar energy. He seems to do fine with both male and female dogs. He\u2019s learning crate training but can be a Houdini so will need a heavy duty crate or extra clips to keep him where he needs to be. He was found as a stray so he\u2019s still learning what being a house dog is all about. He pulls on leash so definitely needs a home willing to do basic training with him and help him learn. We would not recommend him with small children due to his jumping and hyper behaviors right now but with training and brain stimulation he should do fine with older children. \nHe will need a fenced yard to run and play. No apartments as the finder tried that and it wasn\u2019t a good fit for him.\n\nHe is currently undergoing heartworm treatment. He can be adopted now as long as he completes his treatment with our veterinarian.",

Since we don't have a long health history of your\nadopted dog, we can only treat the pet for whatever symptoms present during the initial exam\nand follow up exams.~\n\nHealth: ***** Java is blind in his right eye. No other obvious issues found during vet exam *****\nTemperament: Java is a sweet boy! He is not very active but he does enjoys short casual walks. He is blind in his right eye which makes him a little reluctant to play or try new things, but with a little help from the other dogs in the house, he manages just fine. He gets along well with his furry foster siblings and gets some comfort from being in a pack because of his blindness. Java loves to get right in your face and tuck his head under your chin for attention. It's very endearing and cute BUT he will growl if anyone comes near his favorite person. Although he has NEVER bitten anyone, we don't believe he would be a good choice for a family with children. Adults only for this cutie pie. --\n\nWhere did he come from: He was a stray at the Garland Animal Shelter and never reclaimed.\n\nAdoption: ***** $487.13 Includes Required Tax *****\nWeight: 11.4 lbs.\nApproximate age: 7/15/2015\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: http://www.recycledpoms.org/application --\n\nEmail info@recycledpomeranians.com to request a printable application. --\n\n------Please remember our group is made of only volunteers all of whom have full time jobs, foster fur-kids, and families of their own, so please be patient.--------",

Needs a companion animal\n\nGSRA adopts to residents of VA, NC, and SC only\n\nLoki is a gorgeous large male who will need to continue to work through his insecurities. He walks well on leash, he is non reactive to stressful situations. He is shy to new people and will need a family that will give him time to be comfortable with them. He's a rough physical player and needs a confident companion that can tolerate his play style as well as help him build his confidence when out and about. Loki is house trained and crate trained and a good car rider. Loki has a high prey drive so would be best without cats and his play style is too much for small dogs. Loki needs a family experienced with an under socialized dog. He would be a great running partner. With continued work, love and patience Loki will blossom into a more carefree, happy boy. If your New Years resolution was to get more exercise then Loki is the guy to help you.\n\nFor more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n\nPlease join us at our next Event(s):\n\nCurrent Scheduled Events:\n\n2/1/21 8:18 PM",

He has not gotten along with other male dogs here at the shelter, but has done well with females.  We do not have any history on cats.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please call 541 474 5458 for an appointment.

Not good with cats.\n\nResidents of VA, NC, or SC Click to apply for Evie\nPlease Note: This link will take you to Dauntless Dog Rescue of Wilmington, NC.\n\nMeet Evie! If you are looking for a smaller sized, lower energy German, then Evie is your girl! She is well past the puppy stage, housebroken, and trustworthy out of her crate. Evie gets along great with both male and female dogs. However, she does want to chase kitties so a home without cats and very small dogs would likely be best. Evie LOVES car trips and is a very well behaved walking buddy. While Evie is initially shy, she has made great strides since rescue and once she warms up she is happy to snuggle and read by the fire. Evie will need a patient home as she takes a little time to adjust but once you earn her trust she is a great companion.\n\nClick to apply for Evie\nPlease Note: This link will take you to\nDauntless Dog Rescue of Wilmington, NC\n.\n\nFor more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n\nPlease join us at our next Event(s):\n\nCurrent Scheduled Events:",

He is a Black Lab male, approx. 2-3 years old, 56 - 60 pounds, super sweet with a Pepe Le Pew like banner of a tail!\n\nJ-Jackson was in front of a sheet metal shop for at least 4 weeks while workers fed and watched over him and then contacted us. Luckily we were able to capture him and bring him to safety. Turned out J-Jackson was adopted not long before from Cullman County Animal Control. The family who adopted him doesn't have a fenced-in yard. He regularly visited neighbors who gave him all different names, food, etc. The family agreed to allow us to rehome this wonderful boy to a home that could give him what he needs to stay safe!\n\nJJ is housebroken, crate trained although prefers to be in one's lap and arms. He is a big love bug, hasn't chewed anything other than bully sticks and femur bones! He is talkative and thinks he is having human conversations with you! haha. He loves to eat, have treats, and mostly enjoys hugs! JJ would prefer a home with a stay-at-home family member, large fenced in yard to explore and roam when he isn't in the house being loved on next to you. He is fine with other dogs. We were told fine around children and just a great dog!\n\nJ-Jackson will be fully medically vetted plus microchipped before going to his forever home. To be considered please complete a pre-adoption application on our website http://www.southernskiesresscue.org/adoption-application",

Due to the volume of interest in our animals and the convenience we now offer of applying online for adoption, we are no longer able to reply to messages sent through our Petfinder page. MESSAGES RECEIVED THROUGH PETFINDER WILL GO UNANSWERED.\nCopy and paste this URL link to learn everything you need to know about the adoption process and to fill out the application.\nhttps://www.grandstrandhumanesociety.com/adopt/\n\nSay hello to Scrap and Trooper! (Scrap is the bigger one) They are both very friendly, seemingly house trained, middle-aged dogs that seem fine with other dogs and lived with a cat.\nScrap is very nervous about strangers approaching and reaching into his crate! But really all he wants is to be let out on his own and then he\u2019s fine. We have been working with him on this for a week and now he seems to be fine with people reaching into his crate. On a leash he seems to love everyone he meets! We even took him to the doctor to get his ear meds and he was PERFECT about it!\nTrooper is one of the friendliest dogs ever as well! So sweet and happy to meet everyone (even in his crate lol).\nThey absolutely love each other and we really want to keep them together! It took a week or so before we could even walk them separately, and we think they would be really sad if separated.\nThese are WONDERFUL, friendly, well-behaved goofy angels! They were surrendered to us after their human mama passed away and no one could take them in. They did nothing wrong and could use a good home to help them though their tough time.\n",

Ellory will thrive in a home that understands her limitations. She bonds very strongly to those she loves and has learned what it's like to be a valued member of a family. She is absolutely perfect with clicker and positive reinforcement training. Her foster has been using these methods to encourage leash walking and body handling. Ellory is best suited in a multi-dog home. The age of the children she's best around will depend largely on the parental supervision and experience with under-socialized dogs. Ellory is in foster in Loveland. Her adoption fee is $400. REQUIREMENTS: 1. Fenced in yard 2. Willingness to continue POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT training only. 3. Experience with under-socialized dogs. 4. Resident dog(s).  You can apply for Ellory at https://milehighcanine.org/forms-and-applications/mhcr-adoption-application/.",

            "description": "Zorro (aka Zeus) is an awesome 1-1/2 year old male Pit Bull Terrier who was surrendered by his owner on January 4, 2021 because he could no longer take care of him.  Zorro was accompanied by his beautiful companion (Baby Girl) who had shared his home.\n\nZorro has a tan short smooth coat with subtle blue/black shading, a tiny spot of white on his chest, a long tail, and a handsome face with beautiful brown eyes, a blue nose, and short semi-erect ears.\n\nHis owner told us that Zorro is good with children and also with other dogs.  He has been kept indoors and is still working on his housetraining skills.  Zorro has occasional accidents if left alone too long.  He is frightened of vacuum cleaners and cowers to show his fear.\n\nHis  favorite activity is playing with tug-of-war rope toys.\n\nZorro's only known behavioral issues are chewing and chronic escaping from his fenced-in yard.  So he needs close supervision to help him be a 'good boy' :)\n\nZorro weighs 50 lbs.  He is very energetic and strong on the other end of a leash.  Zorro tends to grab his leash thinking it is a great impromptu tug-of-war toy.\n\nZorro will be neutered before being adopted by his new family.\n\nUPDATE: Zorro was neutered on January 25, 2021 and was also given rabies vaccine.\n\n",

He is a sweet old guy with some wobbly back legs,  but even that does not slow him down outside. He loves to walk around the backyard and peruse his newest \u201c hood\u201d. He so wants to have a friend as he made many attempts to be best buds with the little shitzu I had here until today. He is hw negative, completely and totally house broken; likes to sleep in HIS bed that he had stuffed into his luggage to make the trip to his temporary quarters, and just wants to participate. Easy going little guy who occasionally wails as he is in mourning. He takes a pain pill for his arthritis twice a day and has a flea allergy with some itchy spots, but who among us doesnt have something to deal with. \n\nDoes your heart and home have room for this 17 lb special boy?

            "description": "MEET BLEU!!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue. Different policies and fees may apply.\n\nFor more information or to schedule an appointment to meet this pet, please complete a Dog Adoption Questionnaire online at lostourhome.org You can also contact Lost Our Home at 602-445-PETS (7387) or email us at adoptions@lostourhome.org.\n\nHere's what the day foster says about this special boy! Please read all about me to see if I would be the right fit for you........\n\nBleu is an incredible boy! It was our first time to meet and within the first half hour together he was comfortable and happy. He hopped right in and out of the car, waiting to be invited to hop out at our destinations. He enjoyed the car rides, either putting his nose out the window or being the perfect co-pilot.\n\nBleu LOVED every moment of our four-mile trail hike. He's active, athletic, engaging and genuinely happy. You find yourself smiling along with him. He's inquisitive and enjoys exploring. He discovered the creek bed and had the time of his life splashing around and running back and forth. He was well behaved with Tweety and Trumpet as his trail companions. He would look back to check that they were still behind him.\n\nAs a deaf dog\n, he's very well adjusted and trusting of his handler. He bonds quickly and loves completely. He is everything a two-year-old boy should be, full of life. He will benefit from a home and family dedicated to his continued success and he will thrive as he continues to learn more as he so smart and engaged with his humans.\n\nAt one point, an older woman approached Bleu and he graciously accepted her pets. She walked with us for a bit while we talked and Bleu walked politely with us. She complimented his manners as she parted ways with us. He reads his \"audience\" very well for his age.\n\nBleu is an absolute treasure!\n\nHi folks! I am a full of energy pup who sure loves adventure. I like having a doggy companion who wants to romp and play with me. My current obsession...TOYS! Boy am I real sucker for my toys. I can coexist great in a home with small and large dogs that are READY TO RUMMMBBBLLLE but also know how to just chill and hang out sometimes and don't mind SHARING their toys with me too ;) I am a strong, handsome guy who needs a lot of exercise and play time to keep me looking so healthy and my spirit so youthful! I'll always take a break from activity for some cuddles though. I can walk well on a leash! I'm always on the go so apartment life is not really going to be my style.\n\nI will do best in an adult home with no cats, that is set up for a big boy like me to have my own space. Another fun fact about me, I am deaf! This makes me hypersensitive to anything that causes vibrations through the ground. These weird objects vibrating the ground can make me reactive, but don't worry, I'm probably more scared than you are! Just take caution with things like vacuums and lawnmowers when I'm around...I'll want to protect you from them sucking you in!\n\nI am working with our Lost Our Home dog behaviorist to learn some manners and become the best boy possible. If you are willing to continue my training, I will be the perfect doggo for you. Please apply if you would like to meet me and my foster mom can tell you how amazing I truly am!\n\nAll dog adoptions include the following:\n\n--Spay/neuter surgery\n\n--All current vaccinations\n\n--Microchip with free chip registration\n\n--Free wellness exam through VCA Animal Hospitals\n\n--Access to our Behavior Helpline for the lifetime of the pet\n\n--Two free one hour professional training sessions good for one year after the date of adoption",

Jack's peppy, can-do attitude is as infectious as his handsome smile! After being surrendered by his owner, who could no longer give Jack the life he deserved, this handsome 2 year old pup is ready for more days of play and fun, with his new family. Though Jack has not officially been evaluated yet, we do know that he does not take to sharing his food bowl well. Jack does not seem to get along with other canine friends, so his ideal home would be without any other pets. Jack has been waiting for the right person to come along and sweep him off his feet!",

            "description": "Slinky is always on the move! She is about 9 months old and is a Boxer. She is full of typical Boxer wiggles and loves everyone she meets. Slinky is house trained with access to the yard at her foster home. She prefers only being in her crate at meal time, but is working on being fully crate trained. Slinky is outgoing and not a watch dog. She can be choosy with her dog friends and is working on not getting excited around other dogs in her foster home so for now, she needs to be the only dog in her forever home. She thinks kitties are for chasing so will also need a forever home without cats. She loves to play with toys and with her foster family. Slinky is an active dog that would love an equally active family that can keep up with her bouncy Boxer personality and give her plenty of mental and physical exercise every day. A walk around the block isn't going to cut it for this girl. She's ready for multiple walks, hikes, playing in the yard, and puzzles, training exercises and working on her basic obedience commands. After her energy is spent, Slinky loves to cuddle up as close as she can to you. She is the ultimate snuggler. She is fostered with two children and is very gentle with them. She would love kids in her forever home to play with and love on her. If you are interested in meeting Slinky, your first step would be to submit an adoption application on our website. If you are already approved with an adoption coach or have adopted from us before, reach out to your coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org.

So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "Precious is a 10-year-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, 4dx/heartworm tested, and spayed. This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. Precious would do best in a home with children over the age of 12. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption!

Baby Girl was accompanied by her handsome companion (Zorro aka Zeus) who had shared her home.\n\nBaby Girl has a tan short smooth coat with a large white bib on her chest, white socks on her paws, a long tail, and a gorgeous face with amber-colored eyes, white markings on her muzzle/forehead, a liver-colored nose, and short floppy ears.  \n\nHer owner told us that Baby Girl is good with children and also with other dogs.   She has been kept indoors and is still working on her housetraining skills.  Baby Girl has occasional accidents if left alone too long. \n\nBaby Girl knows some basic commands (sit, speak, and shake).  She is frightened of loud noises and vacuum cleaners.    Baby Girl is protective of her toys and food.\n\nHer favorite toys/activities are playing with squeaky toys, running, fetching, and tug of war. \n\nBaby Girl is being listed as a 'Special Needs Dogs' since she has shown signs of possible seizures.\n\nBaby Girl weighs 57 lbs and is quite strong on a leash.  She has already been spayed.\n\n",

This bonded couple might just be what your heart needs!\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know:\nDiablo and Bella came to Save Me Dog Rescue after their elderly owner passed away. They are like two peas in a pod; everything they do, they do it together. They can often be found laying with their heads on each other for comfort. They would love to have a yard where they could run and play - they are excited and tend to pull on a leash. Their foster parents believe this would also help with their house training as they are not perfect, but they are working on it. Included with Diablo are some fashionable belly bands as he tends to mark in the house. They are crate trained and will only bark for the first few minutes when you leave and then quickly stop (their foster parents spy on them with a pet camera). They do well in the car and do not mind bath time. However, mealtime is their favourite time. They are currently on a raw diet and they absolutely love it. They have recently been getting into little arguments with one of the resident dogs; therefore, they would prefer a home with no other pets and no young children.\n\nSaying Bella and Diablo are the perfect mix of silly and cuddly would be an understatement.  The question is\u2026. Can you handle that much cuteness and love?\n\nFor more information on Bella & Diablo, please contact Marilyne at ellis.marilyne@gmail.com\n\nOR visit our website: www.savemedogrescue.ca\n\n** Adoptions within the province of Ontario only",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

Peanut was recently surrendered to us due to issues with the prior owner's other dog and chewing. We hope to give her everything she needs to be happy and find her forever home.\n\nPeanut loves to go swimming, enjoys tug-of-war, cuddles and being where the action is! Peanut has a velvety soft milk chocolate brown coat that shines in the sun! She adores people, and is super affectionate!\n\nAre you the perfect forever home for Peanut?\n\nAge: 5 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nSpayed/neutered: Yes\n\nWeight: 58 lbs\n\nVaccines: Distemper, Bordetella, Rabies\n\nHeartworm results: Negative\n\nLyme results: Negative\n\nAllergies: None\n\nOK with kids: Unknown\n\nOK with cats: No\n\nOK with dogs: No\n\nLikes & dislikes: Likes water, rope toys, snuggles\n\nAdoption fee: $100\n\nTo Apply:\n\n1) Print adoption application here:\n\nhttps://staffordspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Stafford_SPCA_Adoption_Application_Adoption-Process-04182018.pdf\n\n2) Email to adopt@staffordspca.org OR Fax to 866-522-8042.\n\nPlease see our website for details on our adoption process, and feel free to email with any questions about the process or about the pet you're interested in.\n\nHome visits required and dog adoptions often do require structural fencing. (We make decisions regarding the fencing requirement on a dog-by-dog basis, according to the dog's exercise needs and energy level.)\nStafford SPCA does not condone the exclusive use of invisible fencing.\nWe reserve the right to deny placement of puppies and kittens into homes with children under 5 years old.\n\nIf you can't adopt, please sponsor me!\n\nYou can also volunteer; Get more information at www.staffordspca.org",

This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and housebroken. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption!

            "description": "Just as beautiful as her name would suggest, lovely Venus is a 5 year old, 52 pound Shepherd mix, whose soulful eyes will melt your heart. Gentle and affectionate, she loves to be stroked and have her belly rubbed. Venus is fully house trained, walks well on a leash, and has respectful indoor manners. She enjoys her walks and exploring the backyard but is very content to snuggle on the couch with you for hours.\n\nVenus was found as a stray wandering outside with her daughter. Now safe with a foster family, she is loving her life off the streets. Initially timid and cautious, Venus has warmed up quickly and is now an incredibly sweet and loving part of the household who seeks affection frequently. She can still be tentative and unsure around new people and other dogs, but the patient support of a loving family will help her gain the confidence she needs while she adjusts to her new environment. Venus would probably do well in a home with kids over 10 years old. This girl truly is a goddess, and will make a wonderful addition to any home.\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

The adoption fee for Cindy will be $175. \n\nMeet Cindy Lou! \n\nCindy was living as a junk yard dog with a homeless man who was caring for her and multiple other dogs. When he was able to find housing, Cindy came to us to find a permanent home. Cindy LOVES other dogs and really enjoys playing in our playgroups. Meeting new people is still scary for Cindy, she needs time to warm up and build trust. She would do best in a calm home with patient owners who understand that she is scared, and will need some extra time to feel fully confident in a new environment. We believe having another dog in the home will be very important for Cindy to be successful in her new home. Cindy is friendly with big and small dogs. We aren't sure how she does with cats, but we are always willing to introduce her to any pets in the home. Because Cindy is so skittish, she needs a home with no young children. \n\nCindy weighs about 65 lbs and is between 1 and 3 years of age.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Cindy, please fill out our online application. \n\n",

We are sisters and are looking for a home together.\n\nI am Sugar, a 9 year old, yellow female lab weighing in at a dainty 60 lbs. I am a shy girl when I meet new people but when I get to know them, I am the friendliest girl around. I love to play fetch and if there is no one around to throw the ball at me, I am happy playing by myself. I enjoy walks through the neighborhood and I am crate trained but I prefer to sleep on my doggie bed, I am also house trained. I know my name and how to sit. I love getting attention and getting my hair brushed. I enjoy car rides and snuggling.\n\n\n\nHi there! I am Peanut, a chocolate, 9 year old female lab weighing in at 60 lbs. Just like my sister, I am shy at the beginning and then warm up. I know my name and how to sit nicely and I bet I could learn more commands. I love walks around the neighborhood and hanging out with my sister. I really like treats but my favorite things are toys!!I love having them around me! I am crate trained but enjoy sleeping on my doggie bed. I love snuggles and getting affection from my humans.\n\nWe are looking for a home, hopefully with carpet or rugs, where we can hang out together and spend our golden years receiving snuggles.\n\nMust knows:\n\n-Sugar, 9 years old, yellow female lab, 60 lbs\n\n-Dog friendly-low energy dog preferred\n\n-Cat friendly- unknown\n\n-Kid friendly\n\n-Energy level- low\n\nMust knows:\n\n-Peanut, 9 year old, female chocolate lab, 60 lbs\n\n-Cleft at the top of the mouth, does not affect eating\n\n- Dog friendly-low energy dog preferred\n\n-Cat friendly- unknown\n\n-Kid friendly\n\n-Energy level- low\n\nInterested in adopting?

We are sisters and are looking for a home together.\n\nI am Sugar, a 9 year old, yellow female lab weighing in at a dainty 60 lbs. I am a shy girl when I meet new people but when I get to know them, I am the friendliest girl around. I love to play fetch and if there is no one around to throw the ball at me, I am happy playing by myself. I enjoy walks through the neighborhood and I am crate trained but I prefer to sleep on my doggie bed, I am also house trained. I know my name and how to sit. I love getting attention and getting my hair brushed. I enjoy car rides and snuggling.\n\n\n\nHi there! I am Peanut, a chocolate, 9 year old female lab weighing in at 60 lbs. Just like my sister, I am shy at the beginning and then warm up. I know my name and how to sit nicely and I bet I could learn more commands. I love walks around the neighborhood and hanging out with my sister. I really like treats but my favorite things are toys!!I love having them around me! I am crate trained but enjoy sleeping on my doggie bed. I love snuggles and getting affection from my humans.\n\nWe are looking for a home, hopefully with carpet or rugs, where we can hang out together and spend our golden years receiving snuggles.\n\nMust knows:\n\n-Sugar, 9 years old, yellow female lab, 60 lbs\n\n-Dog friendly-low energy dog preferred\n\n-Cat friendly- unknown\n\n-Kid friendly\n\n-Energy level- low\n\nMust knows:\n\n-Peanut, 9 year old, female chocolate lab, 60 lbs\n\n-Cleft at the top of the mouth, does not affect eating\n\n- Dog friendly-low energy dog preferred\n\n-Cat friendly- unknown\n\n-Kid friendly\n\n-Energy level- low\n\nInterested in adopting?

Piggy loves to run and play!\n\n\nFor more info please email dog@illinoisvalleyanimalrescue.net  or stop by the shelter during adoption hours every Wednesday from 5-7pm or Sunday from 12-2pm. \n\nAdoption fees are $250 which includes spay or neuter, vaccines- rabies, distemper and bordotella, AVID microchip and county rabies tag.

Admittedly I guess I should take it easy on the treats but there are plenty of healthy homemade ones we could try! What's your favorite meal? Having someone to eat dinner with every night would be just the greatest! Don't you think this big ole smiling face would be perfect in your home? I mean, I think I'm pretty cute!

            "description": "This handsome fella is Scotty, a 4 year old Lab Retriever mix that would make the pawfect addition to your home! Sadly, Scotty was surrendered because he was having some behavioral issues in his previous home, that his owners were not able to help him with. They did say that the other dogs in the home would start fighting and he would join in after the fact, but he would never start fights himself. Scotty is a very sweet and friendly boy! All he wants is love and cuddles from his favorite people! Scotty is just the biggest love bug, the second he see's you his butt is already wiggling and his tail is wagging! Scotty doesn't know just how big he is and he does still think he is a little lap dog, so be prepared for him to climb into your lap every chance he gets! Scotty loves laying out in the sun and going for a nice little walk. He is a bit overweight and will need help from his new parents to shed a few pounds! His previous parents did say that he is great with kids, he just doesn't understand how big he is so he might do better in a home with older kids. They also said that he is good with other dogs, it's just when the other dog in the home would start a fight he would join in. He has never been around cats, though. Scotty has done incredible with the potty routine here, but may need a second to adjust to the routine in his new home. He is current on his vaccines, heartworm negative, microchipped and neutered so he's ready to make himself at home with you today! Come meet this sweet boy at the Waggin' Tails Adoption Center in Benbrook, open every day from 12-6 pm, by appointment!\n\n*Please give us a call at 817-249-3647 to schedule an appointment!\n",

WE WILL NOT ACCEPT YOUR APPLICATION FOR BOWIE IF WE CAN TELL YOU HAVE NOT READ HIS PROFILE. HE IS A VERY SPECIFIC DOG. WE WANT TO SEE HIM SUCCEED AND NOT FAIL, PLEASE UNDERSTAND!!!***\n\n*****BOWIE IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH A TRAINER 3X/WEEK AND IS DOING MUCH BETTER! WE WOULD LOVE IF HIS NEW OWNER WOULD LIKE TO KEEP HIS TRAINER AND WORK WITH HIM IN HOPES TO SUCCEED AS A WONDERFUL COMPANION DOG!*****\n\nBo is an Australian Shepherd/Great Pyrenees Mix. At 16 mo old, Bo is learning what its like to not have to live his life on a chain. He was never allowed in the house, and was surrendered to rescue because of his barking. Bo is a very smart boy and is eager to interact with people. He does ok with dogs, providing proper introductions are made, but has shown many signs that he would need to be an only dog (unless you have a very strong-willed LARGE dog like a Husky/Malamute/German Shepherd or Pyrenees.) . He's just a big goofy puppy that hasn't been taught proper manners or behaviors. Bo has a ton of potential to be an amazing boy!\nONCE AGAIN:(due to high volume of applications with smaller dogs): He would NOT DO WELL with smaller dogs, submissive dogs, or cats/critters of any kind.\nHE WILL CHASE THEM WITH INTENT TO CATRCH THEM!!!\nDavid Bowie was in a long-term foster home and has learned Basic Obedience, Crate training, Leash Manners(for the most part), as well as Potty Training and generally learning how to be in a home!!!\n\nBo LOVES people, and is a very affectionate dog!\nBo MUST go into a home with a 6 foot fenced in yard, NO EXCEPTIONS!!!\nBo MUST be an only dog unless you understand that he WILL have issues at first in the new home, and that it is not fair for him to dominate your older dog.\nWe will ONLY allow him to be in a home by himself, or with a STRONG female dog that is larger than 50lbs and younger than 5 years old.\nHe is VERY strong, and will need a strong owner and new family.\nHe would make a great property protection dog/farm dog as long as there are no loose animals, and will alert you if anyone is coming up your property.\n\nHe barks at cars/trucks on his walks so we think a home in the country would be PERFECT! 2/2/21 3:04 PM",

            "description": "Ghia is a two year old chihuahua mix. 7.4 lbs. She loves to be held and would make an excellent cuddle buddy. She does well with other dogs, particularly small dogs. Loves to sleep with you. She came from a home with senior woman, and that is the kind of home she is used to. Her owner passed away, and she is still adjusting to her new situation. But she's fit in well with our other dogs here.\n\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under \"Adopt a dog\"* on our website: www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n\nBring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B. A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\n\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

Romeo was so scared and shutdown, his face shows his worry in his first picture.  \n \nA ranch team member saw this face and was not going to let him continue to be so alone.  So... she went and got him and now look at him!!!  \n\nHe loves his foster sister, has a great appetite and loves to play ball.  His coat looks great and his worry seems to be gone.  Romeo takes a little time to warm up to people but if you go slow and let him come to you in his time, he tail will wag and you may get a kiss or two.  \n\nRomeo would love to be with another dog and one who likes to play. He does great in the car too.  \nIf you think Romy is a good fit for your lifestyle and you have an arm that can throw... he may be your guy. Romeo would love a fence or someone who likes to go on daily runs/walks and can be committed to this daily.  Backpacking and Hiking would be fun too, he asked me to mention this.   \n\nWe have not tested him with children at this time.  Romeo is fully vetted and ready to go. \n  \nIf you are interested, please apply on our website\nwww.fourleggedranch.com\nadoption fee is 250.00",

Now she's ready to find a family to love & spoil her. Valerie is a wonderful, sweet, girl who gets along well with other dogs, at 1st meeting, she is a little apprehensive when being introduced to other dogs, as if she's had a rough encounter with one in the past, but when she realizes they mean her no harm, she's good to go and has a loving personality. She will make a fantastic family dog. She will need a secured fence for exercise and play time, and the rest of the time, she needs to be indoors. She is mostly housebroken, and is working on those skills. Valerie would do best with an active family or a play buddy.\n\nValerie is current on basic vaccinations including Bordetella, been dewormed and is microchipped. She has tested Negative for Heartworms. \n\nValerie has now been spayed as of 1/5/21 and received her required Rabies vaccination. \n\nFor more information, please contact the City of Corsicana Animal Shelter at (903) 654-4928. The shelter is open Mon, Tues, Thurs and Fri from 12:00pm - 6:00pm and on Sat from 12:00pm - 4:00pm.",

            "description": "Snapshot of Comet!\n\nSize? Medium but still growing!\nAge? 4 months\nActivity Level? I play hard and snuggle hard!\nNoise Level? I like to bark occasionally when I play and when I see exciting things on walks!\nGood with Dogs? I would love a playmate!\nGood with Cats?\n\nI like cats more than they like me! (Dog-savvy cats may be okay)\n\nGood with Kids?\nOlder kids only please!\n\nGood with Strangers?\n\nI love everyone!\n\nPotty Trained?\nWorking on it!\n\nCrate Trained?\nI bark some, but quick down quickly!\n\nInterested? Learn more about Comet below!\n\nAbout Comet:\n\nMy name is Comet! I'm a 4-month-old spayed female husky mix from South Dakota. I'm small right now but I am still growing! I came to Minnesota with my three siblings and have been living with my foster mom and her cat. I can't figure out why the cat doesn't want to play with me-I'm SO friendly! Other dogs tend to like me so I would love playdates! I get excited when I see them, but I'm gentle when meeting them, until they let me know it's OK to play. I haven't had any experience with kids, but I'm still working on not jumping up to say hi, so I'd probably do best with older kids only.\n\nI am a curious, confident, spunky puppy who loves everyone I meet. Toys are the best, especially ones that squeak and ones I can chew on. Man oh man do I love to chew!! Sometimes I chew on things that aren't my toys, but I'm getting better at learning with what's OK and what's off-limits. I'm definitely smart, but I can also be stubborn, so I'm looking for a family that will be consistent and patient as I keep learning. After a long day of playing and exploring, I love to curl up on the couch with my foster mom.\n\nI like my crate too, as long as you give me a treat when I go in. And I'm doing really well with potty training, as long as I have a consistent schedule. If I'm in the crate, I'll whine to let you know I have to go outside, but if I'm playing, I don't always remember to tell you before it's too late. Speaking of outside, I love the snow! I like to stick my face in it and eat it up. I'm pretty good at walking on a leash, too! I'm working on staying calm when I see other people or dogs on my walks. Eating things off the ground is also SO temptingI'm still working on \"leave it.\" But I know \"sit,\" \"paw (shake)\" and I'm working on following \"come\" and \"stay\" consistently.\n\nI would do best in a home with someone who is patient and has time to spend being active with me and helping me learn what I need to know. I think I'd like living with another dog, as long as they have enough energy to play with me!\n\nAdoption Fee: $550\n\nTraining Requirement: Obedience Training 1\n\n*Foster to Adopt: I am looking for a forever home now, but I still need all my puppy shots! So I'm looking for a family that will be able to commit to bringing me to all of my appointments with TCPR until I'm ready to be fully adopted by you!\n\nMEET ME/ADOPT ME: If you'd like to arrange a meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting www.twincitiespetrescue.org/adopt/adopt-a-dog/ . A volunteer from Twin Cities Pet Rescue will contact you once your application is reviewed.\n\nFOSTER HOMES NEEDED!!! Twin Cities Pet Rescue is a volunteer-run, foster home-based organization. We can only rescue as many animals as available foster homes. Please consider saving the life of an animal in need and become a volunteer foster home today. To become a foster, fill out a dog or cat foster application on the Twin Cities Pet Rescue website: www.twincitiespetrescue.org . There is little to no cost to foster an animal. Twin Cities Pet Rescue provides its foster families with food, supplies, and veterinary care for its animals. All you need to do is supply the love!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Twin Cities Pet Rescue does not adopt to homes further than 60 miles from the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metro Area.",

            "description": "GUESS WHO IS FINALLY READY FOR ADOPTION!!!! THIS GUY!!\n\nMeet Little Peep! Or as I like to call him \"Meep Meep.\" Our little broken deaf chihuahua.\n\nPeep is one of the saddest rescue cases I have worked with in my career. I got him on Easter Sunday when a friend called us with nowhere else to go. They had found a chihuahua running in the middle of the Parkway down in the oranges. He had what was originally thought to be a wound on his ear and was in a lot of pain. Because it was Easter no one would help and take him. So I said bring him to me and we rushed him to the hospital.\n\nI often explain my first meeting of Peep like that old cartoon. The one where the big wooden crate is delivered and inside is a tiger roaring and snarling like crazy. When they handed me the crate that is what was inside. Literally a 9 lb monster lol. What did I get myself into?\n\nWhen I looked at his ears I knew this was no wound. This was severe and chronic ear infections that had never been treated. He had quarter sized cysts blocking both ears and puss dripping down his face. To this day I have had 4 different vets tell me that Peeps ears are the worst they have ever seen.\n\nI brought him home and started the long road to recovery with him. For the first week I could not even touch him. I spent a lot of time bribing him with cheese and chicken and his favorite, hot dogs. It was clear people had been cruel to him, it was clear he was abused, it was clear he had been through hell. With time he finally started to trust me. I do still have some battle wounds from that time, but in time He finally started to come to me. He quickly became my shadow.\n\n2 weeks after I got him we did surgery on both ears. One was just a removal of the scar tissue, the other was a full TIKA to remove his ear canal and close his ear. The ear infections were so bad that we are just now 4 months later getting them under control.\n\nThis wasn't the end though of peeps medical issues. Shortly after the surgery Peep started to show neurological symptoms so we went to another doctor and did MRIs. It turns out he has bulging disk disorder of his upper back and neck. This is an issue that will affect him on and off throughout his life and he is on rymadel once a day for it. We have been weaning him off slowly but on bad weather days or if he tweeks it, it is still a necessity.\n\nWe also found out shortly after, that he has permanent nerve damage on the right side of his face. Due to the surgery and the damage from the neglect of his ears he has paralysis on that side. Due to this damage he cannot close his right eye and refuses to let me put drops in it. In time he will probably need that eye removed but not yet. Due to this there will be a medical stipulation that when the time comes he will have to be brought back to us for the removal. We will cover the cost and he can even stay with me for the recovery if needed.\n\nFor the past 4 months we have been battling his ear infections which are almost fully gone. He has been changed over to a limited ingredient food because we are pretty sure its an allergy, and although his ears are better he has a number of scars. One on his right eye is due to the puss over years collecting and ripping off. The hair in that spot will never grow back. People have failed him in so many ways.\n\nI have to say His little deformed ears are actually my favorite part about him. His ears will probably continue to be an issue and he will probably need continual treatment throughout the rest of his life.\n\nHe is approx 6 to 8 years old. He has come so far in the past 4 months. He still gets snippy if I push his buttons or push his boundaries and takes a good long time to warm up to strangers, But otherwise he has become the sweetest most loving boy. He loves to snuggle, gives kisses, and get belly rubs. He likes to play and sleeps on my pillow or under the blankets with me every night. He is potty trained and has never had an accident in the house. He knows 4 hand signal commands and is learning more, and has a vibration collar we are training him on so he knows when we call him to come. He also loves my dogs and is a part of my pack. I'll be honest letting him go will be hard as I have considered keeping him often, however as the owner of Southern Paws, other dogs need me. My job is to rehab, and love, and care, but to also know when to let go.\n\nThis is his story. So now this is what we need.\n\nAn AMAZING PERSON lol willing to take him on with all his issues. There are people out there who love little broken dogs and that is what I'm looking for!\n\nHe can not be in a home with children! He needs an adult only home!\n\nHe can be with dogs and kitties though as long as they won't be overly in his face. I need a family with REAL EXPERIENCE who understands dogs and social queues and how to navigate them. I will be 100% honest. He will absolutely bite you if you do not read his signals. I have had him for 4 months and know how to navigate him. Learning this was not an easy task, and it will take time for his new owners to gain his trust and let him be messed with the way I mess with him.\n\nYou also must be willing to keep me updated on his progress and send me pics occasionally. I have grown super attached to my little land shark.\n\nPlease share!! I know that his person is out there somewhere!\n\nIf you are interested in little Peep.

Cows, newspapers, classic movies, a solid game of dominos? If you're that person, we've got the perfect dog for you. Meet Domino. Domino is a sweet boy who was initially found as a stray and after a little convincing, was more than happy to hitch a ride to PACC with our friendly animal protection officer (it was the promise of our gourmet Thanksgiving meal that sold him.) He was adopted out shortly after, but it wasn't a perfect fit, so he's back with us for the holidays. While Domino is excited to indulge in a second special holiday meal at PACC (Christmas Day is also no joke around here when it comes to food) he'd really love to get out of the shlter and into a home. Since arriving at PACC, Domino has shared his kennel with dogs he's just met and did well. In play group, he was appropriate with his greetings and happy to engage in a little bit of play with other pups. He's not very experienced walking on a leash, and would love his new owner to show him what that's all about. Domino is a nice boy who would love to get out of a shelter and back into a home of his very own. If you think you're the right person, make an appointment to meet him today.",

He would do well with an active family that loves to go on adventures. He is well socialized and seems to do well with other dogs. Arlo just loves to play, give kisses, and play some more. Looking for a sweet guy with undecided ears, Arlo could be the one for you! Ask us today how to meet him! \nPlease stop by the City of Jackson Animal Shelter at 140 Outer Circle, Jackson, MS during their adoption hr (10 - 4 M - F and 8:30-10:30 Sat) to meet Arlo and take a leash with you so that you can take him outside for a walk and get to know him a little better.  For more information, please contact Kristianna (a volunteer with Jxn Friends of the Animal Shelter) via phone (410-924-1053) or email (ksaelensybk2@yahoo.com).

            "description": "Meet Jersey (formerly Fred)!!! Many of you saw Jersey in my live feed from a few months ago. Poor little guy was a mess. He had no fur!!! Well now isn't he beautiful?!? This dapper gentleman is a 1 year old basset hound pittie mix who is a low rider. He is approx 28lbs of energy and love. He is sweet and submissive and loves his 4 legged foster brother. He loves to run and play and is full of puppy energy. He is potty trained and crate trained and working on his manners. He definitely needs an active family. Due to his energy level older kids would be better for him as he could jump up and knock down a toddler. He hasn't been cat tested but we can arrange that if someone interested has feline friends!  He is the sweetest boy!\nJersey does have allergies and is allergic to everything lol. He needs to be on special prescription food that will run about 100 dollars a bag but it's working so to us that's all that matters. He also needs citopoint injections or apaquil a few times a year during season changes and high allergy times. I know this sounds like alot but this sweet guy is totally worth it. He is the best dog and has such a sweet playful temperament. He will make a wonderful addition to just about any family.\nIf interested in adopting Jersey please email us at southernpawsrescue@gmail.com for an application!",

She is a great on leash and just all around in general. \n\nFill out an adoption application and come meet Cornflake! \n\nI came to HSSET through the Pound Program, which means I was on the euthanasia list at a local animal control and HSSET pulled me and gave me a second chance at a wonderful life!",

Unfortunately, I don't get along with other dogs so I will need to be the only dog in my new home, and should not be walked in places where I could encounter other dogs.\n\nDue to my limitations of not being able to co-exist with other dogs, I need to be adopted to a home with secure back yard and no other dogs.\n\nI am super outgoing, and higher energy, so I will do best in an active home. But I am also a big boy, so I will do better with older kids (teen+).\n\nLove Messi\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com",

The vet thinks I am 10-12 years old so I say I am 11.\n\nI was found as a stray so I am now learning about living in a house. I am very friendly and love all people. I have lots of energy but I like to cuddle, too. I am working on house training but don\u2019t get it yet. So I wear a belly band in the house. I have some skin issues but it has been treated and now I use special shampoos. I have a slight heart murmur, but take my meds and feel fine! I\u2019m being fostered by Kathi in Cincinnati.\nGets along with other dogs? Yes\nGets along with cats? No\nGets along with other pets? Unknown\nSuitable for kids? Unknown\nIf so - what age?

She has entrusted NCCR to find a wonderful home for her two beloved dogs.  \nNova is a male, 50 pound, 5 year old sweet neutered Lab Mix.  Sochi is an 80 lb., 6 year old female spayed Husky mix.  They both get along GREAT and ride in a car well together.  They get along with other dogs, cats are unknown and they have not been around young children. We'd love to find another home for them where they can stay together. \n\nNova and Sochi are altered, vaccinated (including bordetella) and microchipped. They are ready for a new home! \n\nNova and Sochi are kindly sponsored by Judith Bidwell, Wendy and Joe Santilli,   Heath Forster,  Daniel Courtine in honor of Shiloh, Suzanne and former NCCR residents, Tillie Mae and Bron Bron, Mo and Andrew Broadbent in memory of Benny, Amy Peterson in memory of Izzy, Joel and Rebecca Cuthbert, Peg Payne, Nancy DeLand, Kristen Streeper and Tim and Diane Eades. Thank you everyone!\n\nIf you think you might be interested in adopting, your first step should be to complete an adoption application. APPLICATION to ADOPT: Copy and paste this link in your browser to view and complete the application https://forms.gle/NghtT4WTNiaZu7Cg9. You can also select the link, right click and choose open in a new window.\n\nWe do adopt out of state, however we do not transport or ship dogs.  Potential adopter must be able and willing to travel to the Rescue to meet the dog they are interested in.  \n\n*PLEASE double check all of the phone numbers that you provide as if they are incorrect, we will be unable to process your application.  Please also let your references know that someone from NCCR will be calling them. Most adoption team members call from their personal phone so advise your references that there may be an unknown number or a private number calling them.  \n\nNYS Registration #RR028.",

            "description": "Basil is a quirky puppy with some manageable special needs who is looking for a home. Basil likely has Cerebellar Hypoplasia, a condition where the cerebellum is underdeveloped which leads to balance issues. He is also blind (he is too young to tell if hes entirely blind or if he can see a little bit). When Basil walks, he takes big, exaggerated steps and slams his paws down. Sometimes they even make a suction/squeaky sound! He wobbles from side to side and sometimes falls down if he is extra excited or playing. One of his favorite pastimes is spinning in circles (only clockwise - dont ask him to switch it up). Cerebellar Hypoplasia (CH) is diagnosed by a vet who looks at the symptoms. CH does not hurt and there is no treatment. Circles and wobbles are all Basil has known and he is okay with it. However, between the CH and blindness there are some things were looking for in his future home. If youve read the information below and think youd be a good fit, please email braveanimalrescue@gmail.com or fill out an application on our website at www.brave-animal-rescue.org.\n\nMake sure you watch this video of Basil in action! https://youtu.be/_eR6hCCQ1Cc\n\nBasils perfect home\n-Carpeted floors or several rugs to help with stability and traction\n-Minimal stairs \n-Easy access to yard (little to minimal stairs - FENCED)\n-An easy-going dog sibling. Basil LOVES the dogs in his foster home and would benefit greatly from a companion. He is clumsy and will walk over sleeping animals so a calm and patient dog would be ideal. \n-No children under 13. Being blind and wobbly means Basil needs people who can be gentle and watch his body language. \n-Financially stable. Right now, Basil does not need any special treatment or medication. His conditions (blindness, CH) cannot be cured and it just gives him character! In case other issues present in Basils life, we want him to have a family who will be committed to taking care of whatever he needs. \n-Patience with potty training. Basil IS showing improvement with potty training. He knows where the back door is and he heads that way if he needs to go potty. He just usually goes before he gets there or before his foster mom sees his signal. He wears bellyband diapers when left alone for long periods of time. \n\nOther things to note\n-Basil is estimated to be between 5-6 months old. He is likely a German shepherd mix and is currently 20 lbs. \n-Basil likes very short walks! He is learning to walk on a leash but dont expect perfection. There will be lots of spinning in circles. \n-He has not been kenneled. His foster mom tried to kennel him but he did not like being confined (no space to spin!!!). He is gated in the kitchen at night and when she leaves the house and he is content. \n-Basil does well with cats. He is too slow and uncoordinated to chase or bother them! \n-He is still learning to use the stairs. Right now, they pose a big challenge. He is carried outside when he needs to go potty but that might not be possible as he gets bigger. Its hard to say if he will ever independently master the stairs but he is having practice with his foster mom holding his harness. \n-Basil LOVES comfy dog beds. He has his foster home mapped out and will effortlessly travel from bed to bed. \n\nWe believe Basil is a purebred German Shepherd who was born around 7/22/2020. This puppy is fostered in a private home in Lincoln. The adoption fee is $400.00 which covers vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter(when old enough). The adoption fee helps cover the cost of these vetting procedures. Unless the bio is marked adoption pending, s/he is still available for adoption. If youre interested in adopting this puppy, please submit an inquiry or email BraveAnimalRescue@gmail.com to ask about our adoption process (please check your spam or junk email if you do not hear back from us within a few business days). We are 100% volunteer staffed and will respond to your email as soon as possible. After you have submitted an application and been approved, we will set up a meet and greet between you and the puppy. Preference is given to applicants with a verifiable vetting history, fenced yard, and homeownership. Please be sure to follow us on Facebook and Instagram to learn more about Brave Animal Rescue and our mission.",

            "description": "DOB: 09/18/2020\n\nWe are currently accepting applications to adopt Daisy. If you are interested in meeting and adopting her, please submit an adoption application by visiting our website (www.HarborOfHopeDogRescue.org). Due to COVID19 safety measures, meetings are currently only being scheduled with approved adopters.\n\nDaisy enjoys lots of play time and snuggle time! She is doing very well with potty training and kennel training. She sleeps all night, eats and has downtime in the kennel. Daisy can be very vocal at times and for this reason she will NOT be a good fit for housing with any shared walls with neighbors. \n\nLike the flower she is very bright. She is learning to sit and be patient for treats. If there are other dogs in the home, Daisy would do best with a bigger dog who likes to play. Daisy is full of puppy energy. This pup will play hard and sleep hard. Snuggling on the couch at the end of the day hearing her little snores is the best! Daisy will be a lap dog for life!\n\nAll of our dogs are fully vetted before adoption, including vaccinations, spay/neuter, and a microchip.\n\nThe adoption process consists of an online application, a vet reference, two personal references, and a home visit. If approved to adopt, there is an adoption contract and an adoption amount. The adoption amount for Daisy is $375 and goes toward the vetting and care of all the dogs in our rescue.\n\nAll adoptions will take place in the Omaha NE area and must be done in person. We are willing to adopt to out-of-state applicants, contingent on our ability to complete a home visit, but you must be willing to come to the Omaha area to complete the adoption. We do not ship, transport or deliver our dogs.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Harbor of Hope Dog Rescue, please visit our website (www.HarborOfHopeDogRescue.org) or our Facebook page. Thank you for your support!",

Bruno will require supportive care to ensure he is comfortable. \n\nDespite his injury, Bruno is still an active little dog. He is young, playful, and funny.

            "description": "Shenzi is a handsome 1-year-old mixed-breed fellow who currently weighs about 52 pounds. He came to SFAS as a stray and he is now ready for a new family. Here at the shelter, Shenzi has been confident in our shelter. He can be energetic when leashing up to go out for a walk but enjoys his daily exercise. If you have another dog at home, please bring them in for a meet n greet during your appointment. Shenzi's adoption fee is $130. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Shenzi or to be added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

Then, something happened and Moonflower ended up at the shelter as a stray, toenails still covered in a cracked coating of pink polish. We have tried to find her previous owner but so far have come up empty. Now we are looking for Moonflower's happily ever after. Moonflower can be shy when initially meeting people, but has opened up a lot here. She likes walks, belly rubs, and treats! If you are interested in learning more about Moonflower, please make a phone consultation appointment to get more information about her!",

            "description": "Holly is a 1-2 yr Pit bull mix. She is loose, wiggly and happy! She will sit next to her person without being called. Holly likes to give kisses! She is high energy so this gal would need plenty of playtime and exercise! Holly pulls on a leash but with some basic obedience training, this could easily be resolved. Holly is food motivated. She knows the sit command. Holly is not a fan of cats in a shelter environment. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.joplinhumane.org. We are the Joplin Humane Society in Joplin, Missouri. 417-623-3642 I AM SPONSORED!

They bring the best out of each other. \n\nHe is working on coming out of his shell and not being so shy. He has a protective side and is learning how to put his guard down. Once, he knows he can trust you he will gladly sit by your side and enjoy some belly rubs. \n\nBaxter's ideal home is a quite place where he can relax and enjoy his days peacefully. He would benefit from a home with another fur sibling as along as they were as mellow as he is.

            "description": "I am a 10 month border collie terrier mix looking to find my forever family, preferably one with another dog as I just love them and love to play. I could also use some help being shown how to be a dog (by a dog). I am a little shy (more so around men) but I am working on it. All my other qualities more than make up for that though! I have not had any accidents in my foster family's house, I am not interested in the chickens they have and love the rabbits. I love kids, just love them! Did I mention how handsome I am ;) I do not beg for food from the humans nor do I go up on furniture- I am pretty perfect! Lionel's adoption fee is $375 which covers his neuter, vaccinations appropriate at the time of adoption, microchip and any additional medical care he may have needed while in the rescues care.We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, are NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our websitewww.northernlakesrescue.org",

The adoption fee includes the following: OH license good for this calendar year, DA2PP, Bordetella vaccine, Heartworm testing, dewormer, and spay/neuter.  Flea treatment will be provided if fleas are noticed.  All dogs will be spayed/neutered and microchipped before leaving the facility.  An e-collar may be purchased for $15.00.  Because most of our dogs were picked up as strays, we have no knowledge of any behavior or health issues.  Stray dogs are held for 72 hours so that the owners have a chance to redeem them. After that time they are vetted and placed up for adoption. We welcome and encourage the cross posting of our dog's pictures to increase adoptions.",

Meet Honey!!!!\n\nHoney is a sweet, easy going, senior girl who found herself at a local shelter when her family lost their home. When a foster stepped up we were able to help her. Honey appears to be in good health and is doing well in her foster home. She gets along with other dogs and loves to be with her humans. She still enjoys walks but also likes to cuddle under the covers and just hang out with her people. Honey is looking for a companion or family that will cherish her and give her the best \"golden years\". Could that be you?

He is crate trained, has high food drive to be taught obedience and loves to play with other dogs, but does like to eat his food in his crate away from other dogs (he probably had to fight for food at the shelter, so this should stop once he realizes he has a safe place with steady food). He would love to be an active dog with you or cuddle up on the couch. He comes fully vetted with all vaccines, bordetella, microchipped, dewormed, on heartworm prevention, on flea prevention, is heartworm negative and is neutered. Apps can be submitted to www.islanddogrescue.net or you can text us with any questions to 412-913-8690. His adoption fee is $300.",

Laney was pulled from our local animal shelter where she had been picked up by Animal Control and down there for over 2 months so we knew she needed to come on out.  \n\nShe is a super sweet, loving dog! Laney is very social otherwise, enjoys playing and being loved on, and going for walks on the leash.  She has a nice energy level so she may do ok in an apartment if she gets daily exercising.  \n\nLaney will require a fenced in yard if left outside any off leash.  Laney should be fine around children.  We do allow a trial with an approved application.  We have started on her crate training.  Laney is up to date with her vet care, spayed, heartworm negative and microchipped.  She is on heartworm and flea/tick prevention.  \n\nSuch a beautiful dog, Laney is very ready to find her forever home in this new year!\n\nAll HSWA dogs are either at our Dog Adoption Facility or in foster homes. All dogs require an appointment to meet.  Please call us at 205-554-0011 or email humaneswa@yahoo.com to request an appointment to see the dog/puppy and to check availability.\n\nVisit us on Facebook! www.facebook.com/humaneswa\n\nOur adoption fee is $75.  Read more information on our adoption process at www.humanesocietyofwa.org/howtoadopt.html.  Then, if you feel your home might be the right forever home and you would like to adopt a dog, submit an online adoption application. The online applications may not work on mobile devices. If the online application does not work on your device, look to the right side of the forms page for a downloadable .PDF copy of the application.",

As with most huskies, she is a stubborn girl and very smart! We would like her to be adopted by someone familiar with the husky breed and with a fenced yard. She's OK with cats, but is a bit jealous of the other dogs in her foster home. We recommend older children for her. Elsa is spayed, vaccinated and is still working hard on her house training.

            "description": "Meet Rivers, 4 year old male Labrador retriever/pit bull terrier mix.  He has a smooth black and white coat and is a good size dog weighing 48 pounds.  Rivers was pulled from our local animal shelter where he had been picked up by Animal Control as a stray and no one came to claim him.  \n\nThis fine fellow is the life of the party!  He is fun, energetic, playful and loves all the attention he can get!  Rivers loves to run and play so he will need an active owner.  He is probably too energetic for an apartment and he will require a fenced in yard so he can get his energy out.  But he is not to be an outside only dog, he loves to be with his pack way too much for that.  \n\nHe got along well with the dogs he has been tested with and should be fine with children 12 and over.  He is jumpy so could easily accidently knock over a young child.  We have started on his crate training.  Rivers is up to date on his vet care, will be neutered prior to adoption, heartworm negative and is microchipped. He is on heartworm and flea/tick prevention.  \n\nSuch a happy, fun dog \u2013 what a great way to start the new year off right by adding joy to your life with Rivers!\n\n\nAll HSWA dogs are either at our Dog Adoption Facility or in foster homes. All dogs require an appointment to meet.  Please call us at 205-554-0011 or email humaneswa@yahoo.com to request an appointment to see the dog/puppy and to check availability.\n\nVisit us on Facebook! www.facebook.com/humaneswa\n\nOur adoption fee is $75.  Read more information on our adoption process at www.humanesocietyofwa.org/howtoadopt.html.  Then, if you feel your home might be the right forever home and you would like to adopt a dog, submit an online adoption application. The online applications may not work on mobile devices. If the online application does not work on your device, look to the right side of the forms page for a downloadable .PDF copy of the application.",

He weighs just 40 lbs and we expect him to gain a few but will remain medium in size. So handsome.\n\nHe's had a rough start and we're so happy to be here for him! Rescued from Georgia, he's ready become a Pacific Northwest boy with a loving family so he can leave it all behind. He deserves it. It will take special people to give him confidence and in time, he will be soo happy.\n\nBucky is a very sweet and gentle boy. He is very timid around people but is slowly blossoming. He thrives in the company of other dogs and must be in a home with another social dogs to help him build confidence. He is a little skittish still at times and for this reason we would like to see him with older kids only (12 and up). He will do best in a more quiet residential area, rather than on busy city streets.\n\nBucky is beautiful and so charming!\n\nHe is now updated on all shots, neutered and chipped. His adoption fee is $395.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

I also take her on 1 to 2 \u201csmelling walks\u201c daily, Where she\u2019s allowed to just sniff and go slowly. In my opinion, she\u2019s super smart and needs a lot of exercise and adventure.\n\nShe definitely shows separation anxiety when I leave, but now will eventually settle down and nap or seek comfort from the guys.\n\nHowever, just like my last terrier, she will run away any chance she gets and is always on the lookout for an escape opportunity. Her new family should be aware of this fact and know she cannot be left unattended in a yard or off-leash and must always wear a harness, collar, and tags.\n\nIn general, she really enjoys food and treats, especially hard chewies. For training, she is just as happy to get affection, so we train her with praise and cuddles.\n\nToday I accidentally waved a hairbrush near her and she retreated in terror, shaking. It took a while to calm her. Pretty clear someone used to hit her. \n\nShe mostly goes potty outside, (praise, praise, praise) but we still put down a pad at night just in case.\n\nShe has just now begun to exhibit playful behavior with our family. So far, she hasn\u2019t shown any interest in other dogs (4 lbs to 85). I still think if she were in a household with small dogs who could model playful behavior, she would pick it up quickly.\n\nShe\u2019s vomited every time she\u2019s ridden in the car, so probably not a \u201cride-along\u201d dog.\n",

            "description": "Nelson is an independent, handsome fella seeking his lifetime companion. He loves to explore with lots of sniffing during walks. He walks well on leash, but he has a tendency to pull at times. Nelson was found as a stray, and it took him a while to adjust to the kennel environment at the shelter. He has come a long way and is now much more comfortable with staff and volunteers. Nelson will greatly benefit from a calm, patient home that will give him plenty of time to decompress. Ongoing socialization and structure will likely help Nelson feel more secure. He can still be nervous at times and may become mouthy when he is anxious. An adopter with cattle dog (or similar breed) experience/ knowledge would be ideal. Nelson will likely need some help with housetraining and perfecting his indoor manners. Nelson would do best in a cat-free home, as well as with children age 14 years or older. We don't know how Nelson feels about other dogs, so they will require a supervised visit with staff prior to adoption. Please consider giving Nelson the love and understanding that he deserves and apply to meet him!",

            "description": "Ace is an approximately 2-year-old neutered male 8lb. Toy Poodle and has quite the story to tell. Ace is a tripod meaning he only has three legs; the right front leg was amputated back in 2019 after it broke when he fell off the kitchen counter. In 2020, the left front leg broke when his then owner was throwing heavy boxes in the backseat and evidently didn't realize he had moved from the front seat to the back.\n\nHe came to Speaking of Dogs Rescue in May 2020 from an urgent care clinic when his owner could no longer care for him. We took him directly to an orthopedic surgeon where he underwent surgery to save the only front leg he had left. His foster mom is a vet tech and did everything right but unfortunately after 10 weeks of healing time, the x-rays showed the break had not healed. We became aware of a new technique involving a 3-D printer that might work for Ace. After the consult and workup, we were over the moon to hear that Ace was a candidate for the procedure. Another 10 weeks went by and when the call came from the orthopedic surgeon we were ecstatic: the surgery was a success!\n\nHe is now ready for his new life and family, so here's what we know:\n\nHe greets everyone with enthusiasm and pleasure. So far, he hasn't met a person he hasn't liked.\nAce is, without a doubt, the sweetest, kindest and bravest dog we know. He never complains, he's always ready with wags and kisses for his caregivers and is king of cuddles.\nA primary focus of his care, besides all the cuddles and kisses he's going to be expecting, is to keep him safe and manage his mobility for the rest of his life.\nHe is still learning what he can safely do and not do and needs his new family to help keep him managed.\nHe is easy going, likes curling up and relaxing.\nEnjoys little walks, sniffing about and exploring.\nNeeds a safe environment where he can be all the dog he can be, but also avoid any further injuries.\nA one-level home would be ideal.\nSafety and mobility can be challenging for a three-legged dog.\nIdeally his forever home will provide:\n\nTraction for him - a carpeted home or one that has lot of runner rugs for traction to help him move safely. Another possibility would be grip boots or socks and keeping the fur of his feet short.\nA healthy and fit body - Ace should stay slim, so he does not have any extra weight to carry around.\nAce should either be fed a good joint/mobility diet or a joint supplement forever.\nAce will benefit from a safe exercise routine and /or possibly even a preventative rehabilitation program.\nAce is crate trained and sleeps overnight in it. This keeps him safe when everyone is sleeping and unable to watch him.\nAce prefers not to be in the crate otherwise and will get anxious in a crate through the day and is currently anxious when on his own. He's had 24-hour care throughout his post-op recovery and is used to having someone always with him.\nAce's surgeon has recommended assistance on and off of the couch or bed as well as supervision to prevent him from jumping off and reinjuring himself.\nA follow up x-ray of his leg in May which will give us more of an idea about his future limitations and freedoms.\nAce is housetrained but has almost always been only on a leash or in his \"spot\" a mat or bed, which he happily stays in (mostly).\nAce will need regular grooming including keeping his nails short to help him move around the best he can.\nAlthough he is great with other dogs, he should be the only dog so he doesn't injure his leg playing or jumping with another dog.\nIf he breaks his leg again, he will lose it, so he needs an adopter who will be super vigilant and devoted to his care and good management.\nHe is a young dog with lots of good times ahead of him; he needs a committed adopter so he can live a safe, happy and full life.",

People say that owners are there for their dogs and this is true to some extent, however, I will be there for you when you need me most. For example, in the morning I will wake you up like an alarm clock. This may be because I have to go outside or I am hungry, however, I am really getting you out of bed so you can start your day. Throughout the day I will remind you that I need to go outside and use the restroom. Sure, I have to go; however, this is making you get more exercise. I see you watching that silly reality show and I will bring you my favorite toy. Sure, I want to play; however, I am really saving your brain from turning to mush by watching that silliness. Sometimes I will track a little bit of mud into the house. I do this so you clean the floor that already needed to be cleaned prior to my mess. I am helping you keep the house clean. As you can see, I am a fantastic asset to have around and will always help you. Just give me some food, water, love, care, and attention and our relationship will be stronger than any you could ever imagine. I am excited to go home with you ASAP where I will really get to work for you.",

            "description": "APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS ARE INCLUDED BELOW - PLEASE READ TO THE BOTTOM!  If this post is up, the dog is still available.   We will take it down when the dog is no longer available.\n\nZara is a happy, energetic dog who will provide her family with plenty of love and cuddles. At a little over 1 year old she still has a good bit of puppy in her, she loves to run and play ball. Zara was found as a stray and has been in a foster home with SSCR since November 29th. She currently weighs 45 lbs and will not get any bigger.  Zara is housebroken and crate trained. And although she is a good car-rider, she needs some encouragement to get into the car.  \n\nZara plays well with her foster siblings and has no interest in being the alpha dog. She plays well with children but due to her energy level we think she would be better suited for a home with children over the age of 12.  Zara takes a little time to warm up to new people, but once she does she can be very snuggly, and she loves belly rubs.  She has been living in a home with cats and has shown no aggression towards them.\n\nZara is still learning that a leash is not a bad thing, and her walking skills have improved. She may at one time have been spooked by a door (house) and is sometimes wary of coming in if she feels confined. She is being trained with the 'touch' recall command and is making progress in that area.\n\nZara will require a home with a fully fenced yard, and the fence needs to be 6 feet high because of how agile she is.  When left to her own devices, Zara will get bored and jump over shorter fences.  She LOVES to wrestle and play, so having a young dog who will play with her will be ideal.  We will require at least one other dog in the home, as Zara is much more comfortable when she has another dog to follow.  She knows sit and is learning not to jump, her new home would benefit to continue her training.  Zara is what we call a \"work in progress\"  :)\n\nIf you are interested in giving Zara the permanent, loving home that she deserves, please submit an application through this link. And please read through to the end of this page! When you submit the application through this form, it will email the pdf version over to us. (Please do not print and mail it as it will take much longer for us to receive it!) https://form.jotform.com/202046006590041\n\nDue to the ever changing COVID19 situation, we will continue to adapt our process. At this time, we are not scheduling public events or meet-and-greets in public. We will move straight to the home visit portion of the process, and we are happy to spend ample time with you there as you get to know the dog you are interested in. We ask that an application is filled out in advance of us setting up a home visit.\n\nDetails about the organization, the adoption process, and our adoptable dogs can be found on our website at www.lovethemutt.org. Please note that a home visit is a required part of our adoption process. Due to this, we are only able to consider applicants within a 45 mile radius. In some cases, we may extend this radius at our discretion. The adoption fee is $200. This is non-negotiable. Information about the adoption process can be found on our website under the Adoption Process tab. If you have additional questions, please email us at steppingstonesrescue@gmail.com.",

Poor Hank lived in a feces/muddy/wet outdoor kennel for years. Having been a house dog at one time...\n\nHank had to go to the vet immediately because of his ears. They were in pitiful shape with bacteria and rods. He has had them cleaned and treated and has been on an antibiotic. He will be fully vetted 12-30-20 and barring no surprise health issues or, complications, we will begin accepting applications for him. \n\nWhat you need to know about sweet Hank:\n\nMale, 6 year old, German Shepherd. Plays well with other dogs and is currently in a foster home with two other male Shepherds of equal size and they love playing! Crate trained. Housebroken and a snuggle bug. He will require a fenced in yard. German Shepherd experience is preferred. \n\nVideo of Hank playing with his two adopted, foster brothers (Jaxson and Judd nka Panzer) in the next post.\n\nWe adopt within a 4 hours driving distance of Toledo, Ohio. Our adoption fee is $350 and covers neuter, heartworm testing, microchip, DHLPP, Bordatella, rabies and fecal float. Please read our FAQ section and adoption application in their entireties before inquiring or, applying. We do not pick adopters based on first come, first served. We try to match our rescues with the best homes for them.\n\nhttps://www.deaconshope.org/faq.html\n\nhttps://www.deaconshope.org/adoption-application.html",

Brutus is a sweet and loveable 7 year old Boxer/Pit mix who loves all people, kids and dogs!  He is confident without being pushy and easy going without being a push over. \nBrutus would make a nice addition to any home.  He has the best of both worlds as far as qualities go because Brutus is able to take a long hike or go on a brisk run and then come home and snuggle on the couch.  What more could any dog owner want?  Brutus is up to date on all of his vaccinations and is neutered as well. He has also been working on walking well on a lead and crate training.  All he needs now is a loving forever home.\n\n**PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING**\n\nIf you are interested in adopting any of the puppies, our adoption fee is $495 ( puppies) $375 (adults) which includes transportation from the South and we do suggest putting a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several littermates.\n\n**Please understand that we are a volunteer based organization. While our volunteers try to answer all emails/questions as quickly as possible, below please find answers to some of our most frequently asked questions. We ask that you please read these FAQ's to see if your question has already been answered before emailing additional questions:\n\n- If a dog or puppy is listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Please do not email asking if they are still available. If a dog or puppy is still listed, then we are still accepting applications :-) We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the puppy or dog.\n\n- We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully-grown (or already an adult), based on the puppy's/dog\u2019s physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. We rarely are able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. \n\n- Our dogs/puppies are either at our Adoption Center in Brewster, NY, in foster care, or are adopted straight from transport. An application is necessary to meet any dog/puppy. Often, dogs and puppies are spoken for before they arrive. Many people feel more comfortable with a meet and greet which we completely understand and respect, however please know you are taking a chance of that puppy/dog getting adopted by someone else before hand.\n\n- The way to start the process for any dog or puppy is by filling out an application. Applications for foster or adoption can be found at www.snarrnortheast.org and by clicking either adopt or foster from the main menu. If you fill out an application, please make sure you answer all the questions in as much detail as possible and that you receive a confirmation email, otherwise we did NOT receive it.",

Smoke is about 3 years old, fully vetted, and ready to find the right home. Smoke has done well meeting some of the dogs at the shelter, so a meet and greet would be a must prior to adoption if you already have a dog! Smoke is potty trained and he has some basic obedience training and he knows some basic commands. Smoke has a little separation anxiety when he is left alone but it is much worse when he is in a crate. Smoke does fine if he is left out while he is alone, but he will break out of a kennel if you try to leave him in one. Smoke is afraid of fireworks but doesn't seem to have any problems with other loud noises like thunderstorms or vacuums. Smoke prefers to be a homebody and gets anxious in the car. He was described as friendly, playful, outgoing, energetic, and nervous around new people. They told us that Smoke needs some time to open up to new people but that once he does he is very loving! If you would like to meet Smoke give us a call to schedule an appointment!",

He\u2019s neat: housebroken and rarely chewing on things he shouldn\u2019t. He only barks appropriately.\n\nSweet and warm, Whiskey loves his people, following them from room to room. While leery of new people, once trust is established, he is snuggly and appreciative of any attention. He lived with a family with young children in the past, before being surrendered due to a move. Whiskey loves to play \u2014 whether it\u2019s fetch with his spiked ball, chewing on his rubber or stuffed toys, or just romping with other dogs. \n\nThis guy\u2019s the real deal. Consider Whiskey. Straight up.\n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. Come to the show to find out if this dog is the right fit for you \u2014 it's helpful to bring all family members and current dogs. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area. Questions? Email us at adoptions@sccrescue.org. Hope to see you become part of the SCCR family!",

            "description": "James is just the sweetest and is hoping to catch your eye with his sad pout! This handsome pup showed up with his best pal, Jesse, at our shelter recently as a stray. James is friendly and loves everyone he meets on his daily walks. Being a young pup, he does need some work with basic manners and training. James gets along well with other dogs and was playful when introduced to cats. He would likely need to be monitored with the kitties to be sure that he is not annoying them too much. James should do well with kids, but does have a lot of puppy energy. Get your application in quickly for this gorgeous guy!\n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting James, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment. This is the time when you and all members of your household will come to our shelter to officially make your connection with James.\n\nJames\nPit Bull Terrier mix\nDOB: 6/4/2020\nWeight: 58 lbs.\nHeartworm Negative",

She is very sweet and wants someone to love her.  She doesn't want to run anymore, doesn't want to have to search for food or live on the street.  She wants her own comfy bed, her very own food bowl, but most importantly, her very own family to love.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations.",

I don't like new people, or change... I like my routine. No need for this newfangled nonsense. It's really scary and I have a hard time at first. With patience I have come around to the staff here and now I have a fan club of ladies who argue over who gets to take me out. I'm not complaining!\n \nOnce I come out of my shell I am a complete goober. I am all about hugs, cuddling and the occasional play bow or short zoomie. I make the staff laugh constantly with my silly personality and I won them over pretty fast. But really I am in it for the cuddles. I am happy to sit and be pet with my head in your lap for hours. I do like my time outside but I am perfectly content inside with my humans too (especially if it's cold... I am not a fan. And don't even get me started on this snow stuff). I am probably going to need to meet folks a few times before I'm ready to leave my friends here, but patience is a wonderful thing! I'm looking for an adult only home, kids would be too scary for a big baby like me. I may be able to live with a dog, but I don't like dogs who come on too strong as I take my time to get to know new friends. I have lived with cats before, and I could potentially do it again with a very slow introduction and a cat who is used to dogs (I'm a big guy!).\n \nIf I sound like the guy for you, please call the shelter at 603-472-3647 to speak with an adoption counselor.",

Both Mom and Dad are Huskies. To be eligible to adopt you must have breed experience. Their adoption area is within driving distance to our vet in Davidsonville, MD, where they will be spayed and neutered late May.... NO EXCEPTIONS!! They need homes who have other young, playful dogs and families who will not leave them for long periods of time. No small animals, small children or apartments. Remember, puppies are susceptible to disease, until they are fully vaccinated at 4 months of age. You must have a plan to keep them safe until they're fully vaccinated while properly socializing them. If you are interested and can provide the type of home they need, you can apply on our website.\n\nWe will not respond to your application if you do not meet the criteria above. We will be matching puppies to families based on their personality.\n\nwww.huskyrescueteam.org\n~~Husky Education And Rescue Team is a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in our foster homes all up and down the east coast. We do not have a facility in which you can visit. We find this a huge benefit because we learn our dogs and are able to educate our adopters on what it's like to have them live in your home. Part of our process, once pre-approved, is to speak with the foster for the dog you're interested in. If you're still interested in adopting from our rescue the first step is to complete our adoption application online at www.huskyrescueteam.org/apply\n\nIf you have additional questions please email info@huskyrescueteam.org",

Both Mom and Dad are Huskies. To be eligible to adopt you must have breed experience. Their adoption area is within driving distance to our vet in Davidsonville, MD, where they will be spayed and neutered late May.... NO EXCEPTIONS!! They need homes who have other young, playful dogs and families who will not leave them for long periods of time. No small animals, small children or apartments. Remember, puppies are susceptible to disease, until they are fully vaccinated at 4 months of age. You must have a plan to keep them safe until they're fully vaccinated while properly socializing them. If you are interested and can provide the type of home they need, you can apply on our website.\n\nWe will not respond to your application if you do not meet the criteria above. We will be matching puppies to families based on their personality.\n\nwww.huskyrescueteam.org\n~~Husky Education And Rescue Team is a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in our foster homes all up and down the east coast. We do not have a facility in which you can visit. We find this a huge benefit because we learn our dogs and are able to educate our adopters on what it's like to have them live in your home. Part of our process, once pre-approved, is to speak with the foster for the dog you're interested in. If you're still interested in adopting from our rescue the first step is to complete our adoption application online at www.huskyrescueteam.org/apply\n\nIf you have additional questions please email info@huskyrescueteam.org",

            "description": "My name is Nutmeg and I'm looking for my forever home. I spent my first 9 years as a breeding mama in a puppy mill, so living in a house with people is new for me. At first I was scared, but now I really like this new life! My foster family says that I'm a very loving and affectionate girl who is good with people and kids (there are 3 boys here). There is another Shiba here too and at first I was grouchy and territorial, but after a couple of weeks, we've become good friends. So if you have another nice dog at home, it might take me a while to feel comfortable with them. I have not yet met any cats. So far, my foster family has learned that I like treats and chew toys, but I don't like being alone and will howl if I'm left by myself for a long time. But I sleep in my crate just fine as long as I know someone is nearby. They've also learned that I will try to sneak out of open doors, so my forever family will need to take precautions to prevent escapes, especially if I think they're leaving me behind! I really enjoy exploring the fenced in yard at my foster home and going for short walks. After being confined for so many years, I'm still building up the strength in my hind legs and getting the hang of stairs. But my foster humans stand next to me and take it slow so they can help me if I stumble. I weigh about 25 lbs and am spayed and vaccinated and fully potty trained (foster mom and dad are so proud of me for not having any accidents!). If you live in the midwest and are looking for a friendly, loving best friend, then I'm your girl! I am being fostered in the Indianapolis area.

            "description": "Breed: Staffordshire Terrier\nSex: Male\nDOB: ~05/08/17\nWeight: 55 lbs\nEnergy Level: Medium\nPersonality Type: Chill, Best Buddy, Adventurous, Fun, Goofy, Introverted\nGood with: Adults \nHistory: Transferred from animal control/Stray\nIdeal Home: Family or individual capable of handling a strong dog. No other pets or children. Fence preferred.\nSpecial Info: May know \"\"sit\"\". Loves to give kisses. He seems to ride well in the car. Has a great \"\"sploot\"\"! will benefit from working with a force-free trainer (one session included with adoption).\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

Both Mom and Dad are Huskies. To be eligible to adopt you must have breed experience. Their adoption area is within driving distance to our vet in Davidsonville, MD, where they will be spayed and neutered late May.... NO EXCEPTIONS!! They need homes who have other young, playful dogs and families who will not leave them for long periods of time. No small animals, small children or apartments. Remember, puppies are susceptible to disease, until they are fully vaccinated at 4 months of age. You must have a plan to keep them safe until they're fully vaccinated while properly socializing them. If you are interested and can provide the type of home they need, you can apply on our website.\n\nWe will not respond to your application if you do not meet the criteria above. We will be matching puppies to families based on their personality.\n\nwww.huskyrescueteam.org\n~~Husky Education And Rescue Team is a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in our foster homes all up and down the east coast. We do not have a facility in which you can visit. We find this a huge benefit because we learn our dogs and are able to educate our adopters on what it's like to have them live in your home. Part of our process, once pre-approved, is to speak with the foster for the dog you're interested in. If you're still interested in adopting from our rescue the first step is to complete our adoption application online at www.huskyrescueteam.org/apply\n\nIf you have additional questions please email info@huskyrescueteam.org",

He is a velcro dog that loves to be close to his people - loves cuddling and will nap quietly behind your chair when you're working from home. He's food motivated and a strong chewer - he loves his toys and bones but doesn't chew any of our stuff! He is 100% housebroken and loves to go on long walks - he can get a little excited when he sees another dog but loves all people and getting free pets. He would be best as a single dog in a kid-free household. He's 43lbs of pure love! To learn more about adopting Romeo A827689 from foster, email asoanimaladoption@austintexas.gov!

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Jagger (aka: Kody, Kody bear, Kodiak) is a Shepherd X with an approximate DOB of 5/14/2020. Jagger weighs in at approx. 50 lbs. He is a fun and playful pup with A LOT of energy who would benefit from an active lifestyle. Jagger loves to go on walks, car rides and hikes. He is a shadow and wants to follow you where ever you go. He also likes to go out frequently and run around the back yard. Jagger knows some basic commands and will do well with continued training and learning as he is a very intelligent dog. He is very treat motivated and loves a midday Kong filled with kibbles and treats.\n\nJagger likes to play with his toys, chewing on bones and playing fetch. Jagger is an aggressive player who is very mouthy and nippy when playing, and needs work on gentler pay, for this reason it is best if he is not in a home with children under age 12. We are working on calming him down when he get really feisty, but he is still young and wants to play hard. Jagger was in a previous home with another dog who was more possessive of their food and treats and Jagger did not take cues to stop playing or biting on the dog. For this reason, Jagger would do best in a home where he is the only dog, or with dogs who are tolerant or can be monitored/separated. However, his previous owner said that he did well playing with dogs outside and in doggy daycare/playgroups. Jagger is working on leash manners and does pretty well when he sees other dogs though he likes to try to get to them and he tries to charge moving vehicles, so more leash work is needed. Jagger does bark at other dogs and people through the backyard fence, and he barks in he house when he sees people outside, so no shared walls. Jagger also should not be on a house with cats due to his high prey drive - this is also a reason a fenced backyard would be best for Jagger. Jagger is kennel trained but may whine and bark a bit when he first goes in and when he hears people moving about. He sleeps best with a fan or other sound on. Jagger is still a puppy so he will chew on items randomly and should be supervised when out in the house or the yard. Jagger has had a few accidents in the house but does well when let our frequently.\n\nJagger is a very sweet and loving dog who will cuddle when he is ready to settle down. Jagger is ready for his forever home, if you would like to meet him in person fill out an application.Interested in adopting this lovable animal? Please go to our website www.wagsmn.org and fill out an Adoption Application. Once the application is processed, a Wags representative will contact you, answer any questions you may have, and set up a time/location for a meet and greet! A home visit is required prior to adoption.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt!\n\nBreed and temperament determination: Wags & Whiskers Animal Rescue attempts to determine breed and temperament using a combination of looks, information provided to us at intake, and our experience with the animal while in our Rescue.

Eden is needing a home where she an be the only dog.  Her current home has two others that she is being kept separate from and she is feeling rather isolated from the family.  She deserves to be someone's couch potato and companion and to feel included.  Eden enjoys long walks and car rides, doesn't show any food aggression or toy aggression, and takes treats gently and knows to sit for her meals.  She is friendly and affectionate with people, however she does have a high prey drive, so she can't be let loose with other animals including cats.  Eden is current on her vaccines, spayed and house trained. If interested in adopting Eden, please complete an application today at www.secondchanceforpets.com.\n\n**NOT ALL PETS LISTED ON OUR WEBPAGE ARE IN OUR FOSTER HOMES.

            "description": "**Please apply to adopt only if your are serious about adopting. Vet references are checked**\n\nLily is that quiet puppy that is often overlooked in a big crowd. With her scruffy little face and puppy kisses, she will win your heart if you meet her. Lily and her sisters are typical playful puppies who play hard and long and fall quickly to sleep to rest up for the next round. She loves to play and run, but is much more timid and content to just hang out than her sisters. She loves being petted and held once she warms up to you, but it does take time. \n\nLily is an 9-10week old German Wire-Haired Pointer Mix and she will likely be medium to large when she's done growing. She is up to date on her shots and will be microchipped. She is working on crate and house training, how to play with toys and her manners. She hasn't had any accidents in her crate at her foster's home so far. \n\nLily will need a patient, active family willing to work on her social skills as she is new to living with humans. She learns quickly, but will need time and training, like all young puppies. She will need a fenced yard to run in, and she would love to have another dog to play with and show her the ropes.\n",

To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nTheo is a sweet, friendly guy who loves to play.  He is gentle taking treats and likes affection.  He enjoys meeting people and walks nicely on leash.  What more could you want in a loving companian?  \n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

Iris and her sisters are typical playful puppies who play hard and long and fall quickly to sleep to rest up for the next round. Iris loves to explore and run, but her first love is to be in your lap and have your full attention. Unlike her sisters, she loves new people and sees them as her next best friend. \n\nShe is an 8-week old German Wire-Haired Pointer Mix and she will likely be medium to large when she's done growing. She is up to date on her shots and will be microchipped. She is working on crate and house training, how to play with toys and her manners. She hasn't had any accidents in her crate at her foster's home so far. \n\nIris will need a patient, active family willing to work on her social skills as she is new to living with humans. She learns quickly, but will need time and training, like all young puppies. She is the mischievous one of the bunch, and will play with anyone and anything. She wants your FULL attention. She will need a fenced yard to run in, and she would love to have another dog to play with.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdoption fee $95.00\n\nAdoption application link\nhttps://form.jotform.com/200005720739042",

I want someone to make me feel safe and loved. The staff here is so kind to me and give me all the things to make me feel so welcome. I really would love a family that has patience and gives special lovins! Like comfy beds, tasty snacks, soft pets and sweet talk. Nice walks, and lets me take naps and play when i want too! We can watch tv or we can go on a hike! We can play doggie puzzles and chew on kongs then run zoomies in the back yard! There are so many fun things we can do once we get to know each other, i know we can love each other forever if you just come and meet me!",

She LOVES people and will melt with an ear rub or neck scratch. She seems to be potty trained, she settles pretty well in the kennel overnight, and would do just about anything for a toy. Eager to please and friendly, this girl would do well with an outlet for her energy, such as lots of walks and ball play.  She loves to play fetch!\n\n**Silver does not, however, do well with cats, and probably wouldn\u2019t do well with other small animals either, as she has a prey drive. **\n\nCould this enthusiastic soul be a good fit in your home and heart? If you have questions about Silver please send us a message on Facebook, or email us at scroungydogs@outlook.com. If you would like to meet Silver please fill out an application at scroungydogs.com.",

Xena's wounds have all healed, she's been vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped. She's been well loved in her time at the Winchester SPCA. Xena is one of the friendliest dogs you will ever meet, she has an amazing personality and loves all humans. She loves belly scratches, snow, eating out of your hand, and playing outside. A BARC behavioral assessment has been completed and Xena performed well in all categories except for dog to dog interactions. She will need to be an only dog. We are looking for a special adopter for Xena who can continue the progress we've made at the SPCA and give her the life she deserves. Applications will be accepted at 111 Featherbed Lane in Winchester, VA Tuesday - Friday 10AM to 5PM and weekends by appointment. Veterinary references, landlord checks, and a home visit will required prior to approval.",

            "description": "**PLEASE NOTE** We will NOT consider a home for Rhonda that doesn't have another dog, a fenced in yard, or small children (under the age of 14)\n\nRhonda is a ~7month old Lab x Terrier x Beagle mix that weighs about 30 pounds. She came to our facility very scared, nervous, and shut down- and will need a patient experienced home to get her settled in and learning how to be a normal dog! We don't think she has had a lot of training, socialization, or consistency in her life so far, but we know with the right home she will get there in no time! She is looking for a home with another CONFIDENT and outgoing dog and a fenced in yard to help her acclimate. At this time she would NOT be a good match for a home with children under the age of 14 due to how shy she is. Having a playful dog around her totally changes her personality and brings out the puppy in this old soul! Her adoption fee is $295 and that includes she is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative. If you are interested in adopting any of our animals please fill out an application on our website www.lastchanceranch.org Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Age: 0yrs 8mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

This BIG, thick boy loves playing tug-of-war, going for walks, and running all around the house. He would be best suited with a family that has a big yard or property and with no cats around! He knows how to sit for treats and he listens well! He is still learning and will need someone who can handle his strong pull! After a long day of running and playing, he loves to curl up in bed next to you and sleep the night away. Castle is looking for a castle of his own! He can't wait to meet you and find his happily ever after! \n\nSchedule your appointment to meet Castle and the other dogs onsite at our Petco Ingram location:\nhttps://v2.waitwhile.com/welcome/petcoadoptioncenter\n\nAddress:\n6001 NW Loop 410 Ste 103\nSan Antonio, Texas 78238",

            "description": "Our beautiful Ms Pippy is still looking for a fabulous forever family to call her own.  Over the last 4months in our care we continue to get to know her and tweak what's the best fit. \nMs Pippy is approx 4yrs old. She was previously used for breeding and then surrendered to a shelter.  She has been fully vetted including spayed, full bloodwork, vaccinated and using monthly prevention. She came to us completely lame on back left so we did xrays.  After being evaluated by our orthopedic specialists, she had FHO surgery and she's recovering beautifully.  Since surgery, we continue  to do Adequan Injections, laser therapy, PEMF mat therapy, and hydrotherapy. She is now back to full activity (walks, romps, etc) and using the leg.  She will need continued work building muscle mass and strength.  She is sweeter than sweet, social, and active (did I mention active).  She is in your face, up your butt, and busy. She also has a very high prey drive and always on the hunt. She will need continued formal obedience training and daily individual training to bring out her best self.  Because of both her medical and behavioral needs, we've been very torn on whether to place her as an only dog or with a friend. The last two weeks (while we've been grieving the loss of our bulldog Boz) has proven she needs a medium/large friend to keep her company or she gets into trouble (barking, chasing, digging, shredding, etc).  She is potty trained and crate trained. She is good in the house but could easily be tempted to counter surf or trash pick. She loves going in the car but does not settle no matter how the long the ride. She doesn't want to miss any possible action.  She loves all toys but if not watched she will shred any type of stuffie and rip out squeakers.  While Ms Pippy is social with people, children and other dogs, she is very forward and she will need a committed adopter to help her transition from pack life to family life. \nIf you feel you might be a fit for our Ms Pippy, please visit www.saintlybernards.org and complete an adoption application. \nThank you in advance.",

The people adopted him and found out pretty quickly that he does not interact well with cats. He didn't injure a cat, but it was way too much stimulation for him (and the cat, too). King is a large husky/pit bull mix with one blue eye and one brown eye. He is 67 pounds and is around 18 months old. He is fully vetted, chipped, and his fee is $125.\n\nKing is a young, athletic, and active dog. He will require a lot of exercise to keep him happy and fulfilled. We think he would be okay with a well mannered female dog. Older kids would be best. He does need some basic obedience training. Like a lot of husky mixes, he can be a little stubborn, but is a loving and affectionate dog.\n\nNOTE: We are closed to the public but are doing adoptions via private appointment once an application has been completed and approved. Applications can be submitted at our website, mchs.rescuegroups.org.\n\nWe are located at 101 22nd St. SE in Austin, right next to the airport. It's exit 180B off of I-90, right off of 218 South.\n\nWe do require that potential adopters be at least 21 years old and that any resident dogs be up to date on vaccinations, heartworm testing/preventative, and spayed or neutered.",

As with all puppies she will need a family that is going to be patient while she is going through potty training and will need to be on a regular potty schedule. She doesn't like being alone so another dog to play and cuddle with would be nice.\n\nPlease do some research on the breed as they are hounds and have hound traits, they can be high energy dogs that when full grown will need lots of stimulation and exercise, they do not make good apartment dogs as hounds are very vocal, a securely fenced in yard is a must as with any hound their nose is to the ground and they will follow what they smell and love to run.\n\nThey are said to be good family dogs who will be fine with dog courteous children. They are loyal and loving and want to be with their humans all the time.\n\nHighly recommended is getting her into puppy training as soon as possible.\n\nIf interested, please\n\ncomplete the\n\nAdoption Application\n\non our website at\n\nwww.NeedyPaws.org\n\nand we will contact you.\n\nAdopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nOur $250 adoption fee includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

Welcome the \"Cutie Pie\" Pups - chock full of fluffy morsels to tempt your sweet tooth! Indulge today!!\n\nHi there! My name is Scone and, like my namesake, I am a sweet little treat ready for you morning, noon or night! A 4-month-old male Terrier blend, I WEIGH 4 POUNDS. I am crate trained and am working on my house manners and, with a little help from you, will have them perfected in no time. Playing is my favorite activity and I enjoy it with humans (big and small) as well as other canine friends. I am a great snuggler (I can cuddle with the best of them) and belly rubs are high on my list of favorite things! As a Terrier blend, I have lots of spirit, am loyal, and am cuter than a button! If I sound like the pup for you, apply for me - Scone - today! I promise to be your tastiest treat in 2021! \n\nIf you think you are a perfect match for Scone please complete an application fully: https://www.petstablished.com/organization/243592\n\nScone has been fully vetted, is up to date on all vaccinations and on preventatives for heartworm, flea, and tick. We cannot guarantee breed information. You will find price guidelines for adoption at matchdogrescue.org and you can read about the whole adoption process and what MatchDog Rescue provides with each dog.\n\nThis gorgeous MatchDog is currently being fostered and cared for at our own facility so as to look and feel his best when he meets you on Saturday, February 13th. For the very best chance of securing a meet with this dog, you must be available all day on this date.\n\nIf you see a pending notification on this dog, it means we have informed the lucky family selected as the best match for this particular dog and they have agreed to come to the transport/event with the goal of taking the dog to their forever home. If for any reason this plan falls through, we will change the picture back to its original format and revisit other applications.",

            "description": "I am truly a sweet boy who enjoys laying on the sofa with my companions, be they dog or human, once I am comfortable with them. I do not have any aggressive traits, neither towards food guarding or in self defense when I feel threatened. In the right home with the right family, I will thrive and relax to enjoy life. With the right care, from the beginning, I will learn and grow to be more comfortable in my new home.\n\nWhat I need in a home:\n- I am more comfortable with women than with men.\n- I need a regular steady routine.\n- I will do much better in a home that already has a dog that is comfortable and affectionate towards the people in the home.\n- I should never be yelled at, scolded or in an environment that has frequent loud abrupt noises because I am very nervous.\n- I love to lay on the sofa and I find my crate to be a refuge when I'm frightened or left alone in the house.\n- I am still learning to walk on a leash, so having a fenced in yard is required. \n- I need to be free of the presence of children because I find them very frightening and confusing.\n- I enjoy chewing bones and toys\n- Most of all, I will need an owner that is extremely patient and willing to spend much energy every day to help me become more comfortable and work on basic training.\n\nWhat I am still working on in my foster home:\n- I am still learning to be more comfortable with new people.\n- I am working on potty training and will go to the bathroom inside if I am left alone for long periods of time. \n- I have some separation anxiety and will be destructive with things that are left out. \n\nI am currently being fostered in a home with another dog and a man that has been able to discover the issues and the solutions for my new family. My foster father is willing to work with and help my new family to insure the success of my placement into a safe environment where I can function and become a contributing member of my new family. Please email adoptions@angelsofassisi.org or fill out an adoption application if you are interested in learning more about me!",

She is well trained in her commands, great on a leash, and wonderful in the car.  Bella would do better in a home with other dogs (she is also cat friendly) and an owner who can keep her company throughout her days.\n\nAt 10 years young Bella still has great pep in her step and would love to keep her owners active by taking walks as well as naps on the couch wuth them and snuggling.The best of both worlds!  If you are looking for the perfect companion who will capture your heart, then Bella is the gal for you.\n\n\n\n**PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING**\n\nIf you are interested in adopting any of the puppies, our adoption fee is $495 ( puppies) $375 (adults) which includes transportation from the South and we do suggest putting a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several littermates.\n\n**Please understand that we are a volunteer based organization. While our volunteers try to answer all emails/questions as quickly as possible, below please find answers to some of our most frequently asked questions. We ask that you please read these FAQ's to see if your question has already been answered before emailing additional questions:\n\n- If a dog or puppy is listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Please do not email asking if they are still available. If a dog or puppy is still listed, then we are still accepting applications :-) We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the puppy or dog.\n\n- We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully-grown (or already an adult), based on the puppy's/dog\u2019s physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. We rarely are able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. \n\n- Our dogs/puppies are either at our Adoption Center in Brewster, NY, in foster care, or are adopted straight from transport. An application is necessary to meet any dog/puppy. Often, dogs and puppies are spoken for before they arrive. Many people feel more comfortable with a meet and greet which we completely understand and respect, however please know you are taking a chance of that puppy/dog getting adopted by someone else before hand.\n\n- The way to start the process for any dog or puppy is by filling out an application. Applications for foster or adoption can be found at www.snarrnortheast.org and by clicking either adopt or foster from the main menu. If you fill out an application, please make sure you answer all the questions in as much detail as possible and that you receive a confirmation email, otherwise we did NOT receive it.",

            "description": "Eve came to us with a basket full of rowdy puppies. She was a great mom and passed on her friendly, outgoing personality to her puppies. Eve came to us from the panhandle of Florida not long after Hurricane Michael. We don't think she's had the easiest life, but she is anxious to live in comfort now. She was recently returned to us as she likes to go on adventures and needs not to be left alone in the yard. She would do best in a home where she will get lots of exercise and maybe a basic obedience class or two.\n\nPlease visit our website at faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets if you are interested in adopting.\n\nI am a mixed breed dog. This means I don't have a specific recognizable breed. The rescue uses the following guide which are guesses based on my current size and age for how big I will be when full grown: Mixed Breed (small) up to 25 pounds - Mixed Breed (medium) between 25-45 pounds - Mixed Breed (large) more than 50 pounds. For more information on, please visit the website https://faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets.\n\nWe are setting up adoptions with approved adopters on an appointment basis. We are no longer hosting adoption events at PetSmart until further notice. We are not arranging meet and greets; but appointments to finalize adoptions to limit exposure for all. Our adoptions come with a one week trial period in which if things are not working out, we will refund your adoption fee if you decide to return your newly adopted Faithful Friend. Our adoptions must be done in person and we do not arrange transport to adopters. Our adoption fees vary and we are only able to accept payments by card* at this time but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip.",

Be sure to tell them ARK sent you!  \n\nAre you looking for a dog who\u2019s sweet as sugar? Look no further than Toffee, a 6-year old medium sized lab and boxer mix located in the greater Boston area. She is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, and available for adoption in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire! Toffee is the perfect balance between a mellow and energetic nature. She\u2019s simply hoping for a family who will take her outside, feed her lots of treats, and let her love on them!\n\nToffee loves to spend time outside, either running, playing, and hunting squirrels during the day or hanging out with her people in the evening. When it comes to playtime, she loves many different activities, from playing tug of war to chasing balls to chewing stuffed animals. After a long day of play, Toffee enjoys cuddling on the sofa with her people. She is very attached to her humans, and is the queen of giving sad eyes when they leave the house! \n\nTrue to her lab nature, the one thing Toffee loves as much as people and playtime is FOOD! Her favorite treats include carrots and broccoli, and she likes to wander around the kitchen or watch from her dog bed while meals are being fixed. Toffee is also a smart girl who will sit politely and shake paws for treats. Her food motivation could come in handy, as she can be mischievous and needs to be trained not to rip up the mail and bark at passing dogs and the vacuum cleaner.\n\nA sweet dog like Toffee deserves a special home. Her home MUST be pet free, as she has previously picked fights with neighborhood dogs! Toffee also needs an adult-only family. Additionally, she would love to have a fenced yard with plenty of space to run and explore!\n\nToffee has many favorite things, but the most important one is human love. As a medium-energy, affectionate dog, she would be a great fit for many different families. If you are interested in adopting or fostering, please fill out an application at survivortails.org or email adoptions@survivortails.org with any questions. PLEASE tell them ARK sent you! #ARKforToffee #JustSaveThem\n\n\n\n~ THIS IS A COURTESY POST PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT MASSPAWS ~\nThis dog is with Survivor Tails Animal Rescue (STAR) please fill out an application: survivortails.org or email adoptions@survivortails.org with any questions.

I spent the first few years of my life outside, but now I'm loving snuggling in my crate, with my foster humans, and my foster puppy brother.\n\nI have gained so much confidence in my foster home, meeting new humans and new dogs, who I have all gotten along with. I am learning how to play with other dogs without getting too excited! I love my crate. I sleep in there all night, and go in even during the day when I need a break. I also eat my meals there.\n\nI am up to date on all my shots, and while I am Heartworm positive, I have finished my meds and will be having my treatment very soon and will need about 30 days of downtime to recover.  I have also been spayed. I'm getting better on my leash manners each day, and I am also learning how to sit and lay down. Can we do that together as I recover.",

I don't care if it is raining in Spain, all I want to know is where my next home is. I always have a smile on my face and will brighten up anyones day. I'm not an old stooged like my namesake! So won't you be my fair lady and come get me?\nHere is what the staff has to say about me:\nHenry is a sweet dog that was picked up on the lam. He is a social guy that is surprised that he is in the shelter. We are thinking the boy is around 2/3 years and is 70 pounds. He came in wearing a nice coat so he was loved at one time. Too come down to see this smiling boy today!\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the animals! If you call the Pampa animal shelter please refer to the animals by their number listed after the names. Thank you for you cooperation!",

            "description": "This handsome boy is 10 month old Lenny. He has been through several homes, through no fault of his own. His first family got transferred to Korea and the cost of shipping a dog overseas is really expensive ($6,000 at least). Plus it is stressful for the dog to be transfered and they opted to not take Lenny. They gave him to someone who then saw an opportunity to make some money and sold him on Craig's List. \n\nThe person that bought him did not realize how much energy a young Golden Retriever boy has and living in a tiny apartment was not the right home for Lenny. Even though the owner took Lenny to doggy daycare 3 days a week, it was just not enough to wear the boy down. So Lenny's owner did the very best thing and surrendered him to GRRR to find him a wonderful forever home. \n\nWe had an approved applicant who has with another high energy dog and a big yard for the boys to romp in and a 6 foot fence to keep them safe. So as long as the dogs get along then Lenny will be in his forever home. If something changes and it doesn't work out we will look for another wonderful home for Lenny. You'll get that news on our website first at www.gr-rescue.org. Please visit to see other golden retrievers for adoption. \n\nTo adopt a Golden that you see here, please go to the Golden Retriever Rescue Resource website at www.gr-rescue.org  Read our adoption policies. If you qualify for this dogs adoption and the adoption policies, please write us for an adoption application at grrradoption@yahoo.com  Please provide your city and zip code. Please note, we only adopt to select areas within Ohio, Michigan and Indiana where we can do a home visit by a trusted volunteer. \n\nPlease read our adoption policies on our website prior to inquiring for an adoption application.

I love to be around humans of all ages, though I don\u2019t do well with the humans raising their voices at me. This makes me scared, so I tend to run to my kennel which is my safe place. I also try really hard to always go potty outside, but sometimes if you scare me or get me too excited I pee a little. I feel really bad about it so please don\u2019t yell at me. I just can\u2019t help it. Now that we got that out of the way, let\u2019s talk about all my great qualities. I really love playing with my chew toys, I enjoy playing and snuggling kids, and most of all I just want to lounge with my humans. Sometimes I like to act tough to people passing in the window, but really I am just a big loving baby. I am interested in playing with my foster dog brother and sister, but I can\u2019t meet them just yet. I believe I can be friendly to other dogs though, since I don\u2019t like to be aggressive. I am kind of a chicken at times. I really just want a family of any size to love me, be patient with me, and let them show just how much love I have to give. I have been through a lot in my doggy life, so who is ready to show me the bright side of life with my fur ever family?\n\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

He back legs are weak which makes it hard for him to move quickly but he is getting stronger on each walk. When we got him he could barely walk one block now he is trotting and can go a couple of miles at a normal pace.\nHe gets along with dogs, cats, and kids in his foster home. He is potty trained and will use a bell if needed. He cannot do stairs but can do steps. He has learned to love his orthopedic beds! He is not a barker and comes when called. He has beautiful markings and doesn't shed much. He is on a diet and has lost several pounds but needs to lose more to improve his movement. He is starting to appreciate affection and wants in on it anytime he sees an opportunity. He is low energy but needs regular walks. He just needs a patient, loving family to be his forever family. He will be very loyal in return.\nDonut is in a foster home with other dogs, cats, and school aged children that he does well with.\nPlease consider making this handsome boy a member of your family. As we are a foster based rescue, we do require a completed application to be submitted before we arrange a meet. This can be found on our website at : https://almosthomepetrescue.org/apply-now-1\n$150 adoption fee includes core vaccinations, rabies vaccination, heart worm test (in dogs over 6 months of age), microchip and registration, spay/neuter, wormer and flea and heart worm prevention while the dog is in our care.

He back legs are weak which makes it hard for him to move quickly but he is getting stronger on each walk. When we got him he could barely walk one block now he is trotting and can go a couple of miles at a normal pace.\nHe gets along with dogs, cats, and kids in his foster home. He is potty trained and will use a bell if needed. He cannot do stairs but can do steps. He has learned to love his orthopedic beds! He is not a barker and comes when called. He has beautiful markings and doesn't shed much. He is on a diet and has lost several pounds but needs to lose more to improve his movement. He is starting to appreciate affection and wants in on it anytime he sees an opportunity. He is low energy but needs regular walks. He just needs a patient, loving family to be his forever family. He will be very loyal in return.\nDonut is in a foster home with other dogs, cats, and school aged children that he does well with.\nPlease consider making this handsome boy a member of your family. As we are a foster based rescue, we do require a completed application to be submitted before we arrange a meet. This can be found on our website at : https://almosthomepetrescue.org/apply-now-1\n$150 adoption fee includes core vaccinations, rabies vaccination, heart worm test (in dogs over 6 months of age), microchip and registration, spay/neuter, wormer and flea and heart worm prevention while the dog is in our care. All breed and size categorizations are estimates.",

            "description": "The Snowball pups will bring some cheer to your winter season! These lithe, long legged cuties are around 3 to 4 months old and we think they may have some Terrier and Shepherd in them but are likely a mix of many breeds. Their mama, Snowball, is a true Heinz-57 and is medium in size. We don't know dad but suspect these puppies will be medium in size when they are done growing. Ice is a sweet little snuggle bug. She is doing well with house training and sleeps through the night in her crate. Ice is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

            "description": "Sweet Snowball's story is one of resiliency. This poor mama was found emaciated and chained to wall with her four puppies. Labs and More took this family in and got them the care they desperately needed. Several meals, a warm bed and loving foster home and now Snowball is full of life and ready to go! We think she is around 4 years old is possibly a Terrier and Shepherd mix. She is likely a mix of many breeds with those floppy ears and long, thin legs. Snowball is a playful girl that loves toys and is starting to warm up to the dog she is fostered with. She is learning to share with him and doesn't love every dog she meets so will need a family that will continue her dog socialization. She likes to cuddle close to her people and is always down for a good belly rub. Snowball is still brushing up on her manners, including jumping and getting overly excited at meal time. She's learned \"sit\" and \"come\" in her foster home and is working on her crate training. She is a vocal girl that may not do best in a home with shared walls like an apartment. She goes for 2 walks a day with the occasional 3 to 6 mile hike with her foster family. Snowball is still working on her confidence and will need a patient family ready to commit to the continued training and socialization she will need. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Snowball, then fill out an adoption application on our website today!

            "description": "The Snowball pups will bring some cheer to your winter season! These lithe, long legged cuties are around 3 to 4 months old and we think they may have some Terrier and Shepherd in them but are likely a mix of many breeds. Their mama, Snowball, is a true Heinz-57 and is medium in size. We don't know dad but suspect these puppies will be medium to large in size when they are done growing. Crystal is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today!

            "description": "The Snowball pups will bring some cheer to your winter season! These lithe, long legged cuties are around 3 to 4 months old and we think they may have some Terrier and Shepherd in them but are likely a mix of many breeds. Their mama, Snowball, is a true Heinz-57 and is medium in size. We don't know dad but suspect these puppies will be medium to large in size when they are done growing. Snowflake is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

I am in need of a foster home that can help an old man out. \n\nI have glaucoma in both eyes that was never treated. This has caused me to have no vision in one eye and limited vision in the other. I will have to have eye drops for the rest of my life. \n\n********PLEASE READ BELOW PRIOR TO EMAILING IN**********\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog or any other from our rescue, please go to https://www.hobocare.org/adopt to review our home requirements and fill out an application. Please do not email and ask for more information on how to adopt, all the information is already available online. The information you see here is all that is currently available about this dog.

            "description": "Clyde is a pretty typical hound who leads with his nose and loves food! He is looking for a fenced yard, a home with no small children (under about 10) and a dog buddy or two. He prefers someone to be home more often than not, but is doing well with having other dogs around and may be ok left unattended for 4-6 hours at a time. He is potty trained, knows basic commands and is working on leash skills. While hs is not typically affectionate, Clyde is a great companion to have around. He stays off the furniture, will do anything for a treat, and isn't typically needy once comfortable in your home.\n\nClyde can be leery with strangers, but warms up just fine with treats and some space. Clyde can get very intent on something (food, trash, prey) and not want to give it up, so training is highly recommended and is why we are recommending he not be homed with small children. He has been very responsive to correction and is starting to cooperate with the humans much more frequently in this area. \n\nClyde is up to date on all vaccinations, weighs about 50lbs and comes with a free training session from our partner Just like Magic LLC to start your friendship off on the right foot. \n\nHis adoption fee is $150.",

Jules is the sweetest companion, and she never tries to nip at her human companions, and only barks if something alerts her at the front door. She loves walks and running...she'll even enjoy a dip every now and then! She had zero accidents in the house, and rides great in the car. Jules does best with another dog at her side, but would also do well independently. She has zero body odor and the pinkest face, ears, and belly, especially after sun bathing. Jules may have a history of abuse because certain loud noises make her skittish and would do well in a quieter house. Jules is a great eater and drinker. She is currently working on 'sit, 'down, and 'stay, and doing swimmingly. All she asks for is a seat on the bed (if you let her), a couple sloppy kisses, and a few outdoor adventures. Come meet sweet Jules, she would love to be part of a loving and safe home.",

And wow, when it snowed in Austin recently, she was super excited to run in this mysterious white stuff. On warmer days, she's a sunbather who's happy to just hang out in the yard, chewing on bones and rawhide and playing with toys. Leia is a super sweet girl who comes up to her people when she wants their affection, rolling on her back or side for those belly rubs she loves. She lives in foster care with a doggie housemate. They are playful and tolerant of each other, and sometimes give each other kisses. A well-behaved house guest, she has moments of playful spunk, but then is happy to chill and watch Netflix. She's a good listener who understands 'sit' and 'no,' and is happy to sit for treats. And she's a house-trained girl who does well when home alone. She's just so excited to see her person return home! This easy going lady would fit well in most homes, and could either be the only pet or should fit well with a dog sibling of a similar size. She has a possible hip dysplasia, but is still a playful, spunky companion. Come meet her, she'll just ask for a tushy pet and follow you home.",

Please consider making Hopper a part of your family. He is a kind gentle soul, who will love you with all his heart.\nHopper would like to add a few words. \"I really enjoy walking with my friend Leslie. She said I'm a good walker and a good listener. During our walk, Leslie is always telling me I'm such a good boy but I still need to make a few minor changes in regards to that dumb fence. I wish Leslie knew how hard I've been trying to be perfect, maybe then someone will take me home. Love Hopper",

            "description": "Who doesn\u2019t love them a grumpy boxer? Don\u2019t let that grumpy face fool you though!! Penny is absolutely the sweetest girl in town! She is a 2 year old (35 lbs) girl who was found a stray in rural Louisiana and was brought to a shelter there. Take Paws then brought her into a foster home where she is now a step closer to her forever home!! \n\nPenny loves people & does well with other dogs. She didn't react to a cat placed in kennel when she passed by one which means she could be good in a home with cats. \n\nPenny is heartworm negative, spayed, and up to date on vaccines. She\u2019s such a smart and playful girl who knows how to sit on command. She is playful when prompted, and relaxed when it is time to calm down! She\u2019s such an amazing girl who deserves an amazing home, so if that\u2019s you, apply to adopt this sweet baby!\n\nThis dog is a Benefactor Dog. His/her increased adoption fee will allow them to act as a benefactor to other dogs in our care that require special medical care and a better chance at adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (that application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\n The adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale:\nBenefactor Puppies under 12 months - $500\nBenefactor Dogs over 12 months - $400\n\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

Does well with kids but is very rowdy\nSurrendered after he owner moved and elderly family couldn't take of her\nOk with grooming (teeth brushing, nail clipping, ear cleaning, etc.)\nStill learning new tricks!

            "description": "Hey ya'll, my name is Sully. I'm a 1 year old Saint Bernard mix. \n\nI'm a BiG boy! And I'm only going to gain more weight as I fill out. See, my foster mom rescued me from a small shelter. I was covered in ticks. I heard her and my foster human brother mention that I probably had 200 ticks on me that they had to pick off. So as you might expect, I had 2 tick diseases. I have been on medication for the last 3 months to get healthy. I am all healthy now so that's why I say I'm going to be a big huge boy when my body catches up! \n\nLet me tell you a little about myself. I am a happy boy. I love love love to play and my foster mom has said I need to get ALL my energy out daily so I can relax with the fam. So, I really need an active person or family that will play with me or include me in your active lifestyle. I love to play in water. A lot of time, loud noises scare me and I will look to you to comfort me, as a lot of the time, I want to climb in a lap. My mom says \"Sully you are so big.\" Ha Ha whatever that means. My foster mom says I can be stubborn and sometimes she has to tell me several times to stop doing something. So, I need someone who is patient as I learn what you want me to do. I think training will be a great, fun thing for me to learn so I can focus. I am good with other dogs and love to play. I am a very \"in your face dog.\" So, I definitely need a laid back dog or dogs that won't mind that I am going to annoy them sometimes because I want to play. I would do best with another dog in the home. I sleep in my crate at night and I am potty trained. Sometimes, I will bark when my foster mom leaves home or I hear a leaf blow or something ?, so an apartment life wouldn't be good for me. I don't know if I would be good with cats. I am good with kids, I love everyone, but I don't realize how big I am and come in \"way hot\" sometimes ha ha. So, I would be best with older kids, probably 10 years and older. My foster mom says I'm the sweetest thing but stubborn. And sometimes I will look at you with the saddest puppy dog eyes when you tell me no! My foster mom says \"That doesn't work on me Sully, you have to learn boundaries.\" Geez! I guess she is right! ? \n\nI am food protective so I need to be fed separately from other dogs. My foster mom feeds me in my crate and waits until all my foster doggy siblings are done eating.\n\nSo, this is all about me. My adoption fee is $150 and includes up to date shots, heart worm test and preventative, microchip and neuter. I can go on a home visit with you for 1 week!

As with most Chows, he just was not doing well in the shelter environment. Once we got him out of there, he was a new dog! He is a little head shy, but he warms up quickly once he realizes he is safe. He gives kisses and loves to play! Wonder is currently staying at a rescue boarding facility in the DFW area. He loves going for outings with a local volunteer and his Chow to a big park where he can run and play and get one on one attention. He would love to be in a home! Wonder is about 1-2yo and 55lbs.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an application @ https://form.jotform.us/41173109602142.

            "description": "Hello Moto!  We would like to introduce you to Moto. He is a 10 year old Maltese/ Poodle Mix who weighs about 16 pounds. Moto arrived in rescue after his previous owner's health failed and he could no longer care for him, and animal services wanted his medical needs addressed right away. His foster mom says: Moto came into foster care after having surgery to remove benign tumor from his back paw and having his tail removed for the same reason. He has fully recovered from his surgeries and even the vet said he is better off without his tail. Now he has a cute little stub!  He suffers from allergies so this will be an ongoing issue for him. We have switched him to grain-free dog kibble and he loves it and it seems to help. He also takes daily antihistamine and needs eye ointment as his eyes have a lot of discharge again due to allergies.  He is a true lump of love. He is living his best life when he is beside you in your chair, just be sure you have room for him as he can be a bit of a chair hog! He will let you know when he needs to go out to do his business, but he will always find the puppy pad if you need to leave him for a bit. He is not a big fan of walking much, so if you are looking for a walking around the neighborhood buddy, he is not your guy, unless you would like to push him in a stroller, LOL. He gets along great with other dogs and loves his stuffed animals. He will be a great companion for anyone looking for a chair buddy!\n\nMoto is neutered, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, microchipped and has had his teeth cleaned. \n\nMoto is fostered in the Orlando area, and his adoption donation is $250. If you are interested in applying to adopt Moto, please visit www.floridalittledogrescue.com to read the adoption process and complete an application! Please note that emails simply asking \"Is this dog available\" will not be returned, as applications are worked in the order received and availability largely depends on when you apply:) Please also know we do not adopt out of state! Thank you!",

            "description": "Kula is approximately 4 years old and 40lbs. She was a stray from a shelter, so we don't know anything about her history. She is a little head shy and standoffish with new people, but she is warming up quickly to her foster mom. Kula is crate trained, house trained, and has done well with meeting other dogs, both male and female. She even play bowed with her foster mom a few times, so we know she has a fun personality buried underneath her insecurity! She does have a bit of prey drive as she likes to chase the cats and chickens at her foster home. One of the kitties gave her a very firm NO, and she did back off, but we would recommend a home with no small animals to chase at this time. We will make updates once we learn more about this beauty! She is currently being fostered in the Austin area.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an application @ https://form.jotform.us/41173109602142.

I am 11 months old and looking for my forever home! \n\nI sleep really great in the crate overnight or would do just fine out of the crate on a bed! I am very excited and need to get my energy out! I do well on walks and love running circles in the backyard. I haven\u2019t had any accidents inside in a while so I think that I have conquered potty training! I do well with small and big dogs, and would do great with a companion. I can be energetic, so going to family that will play with me to help me get my energy out would be great!  \n\nI am spayed, current on all vaccinations, microchipped and heartworm negative. My adoption fee is $150. I can go on  a  home visit with you for 1 week. If you would like to meet me,  send an email to adoptions.spspca@gmail.com",

As you can see from the information under special needs, he has regained some use of his legs and may well continue to progress.  We don't know.  His owners said they believe he will get there in walking again because every month he regains more feeling and gets stronger.  \n\nBefore Alby's accident he was house trained but now his needs will require being managed.  \n\nAlby is very playful and just wants cuddles and love.  He is great with people and kids like him a lot too!  He grew up with a toddler and there's never been one problem with him and that child.  \n\nAlby is great with other dogs of all sizes and is very playful.  There has never been one incident of him wanting to fight with any dog.  He's a really really sweet dog.  He doesn't foul and he only barks when he hears the doorbell or a new unfamiliar voice.  \n\nHe weighs around 25-30lbs right now.  He can scoot around faster than most dogs can run and he's not the least bit intimidated by his handicap. He is an inspiration, and as most special needs dogs, he will melt your heart with his spirit.\n\nAlby knows some commands that he followed very well before surgery.  He still knows them but with his coordination it's harder for him to follow:  go to bed.  stay. sit.  paw (he would give you his paw like nice to meet you).  down. \n",

            "description": "Meet James Bond! When JB first arrived without a name at his foster home in Texas, his foster mom took one look at his distinguished black coat and white markings and thought that he looked just like he was wearing a sharp Tuxedo!\n\nJB is a 3-year-old Terrier/Chihuahua mix who weighs about 10 pounds. NorthStar found him in a small shelter in South Texas. JB was absolutely terrified and difficult to handle when he came out of the shelter. For a week, he kept to his crate in his foster home, only coming out to do his business, but very closely watching the goings-on in the home. After seeing all the happy doggies romping around in the house, JB slowly warmed up and started to learn how to be a dog again.\n\nJB absolutely LOVES the company of other dogs - he is the smallest dog amongst many larger dogs but loves to run with them and roughhouse and then lay down and cuddle with them and watch TV. He even likes cats! JB is housetrained and also good about being crated.\n\nJB does not like to be picked up - he may have been abused at some point in his life. We do not recommend a home with children, and he will definitely need time to warm up when he arrives in NJ. He must go to a home with a doggy companion and a patient and gentle adopter. We recommend a home with a fully fenced and secure yard since he is too scared to walk on a leash.\n\nIf you feel that you have the kind of home that JB needs & would like to make him part of your family, please fill out an application at www.northstarpets.org & be sure to ask for him by name...that's Bond, JAMES BOND TX!",

Hodore was just neutered and has to wear a cone for a couple of days. He loves attention, treats and to go for hikes,\n\nHe needs some leash training since he does like to pull a little. We are trying to work on that. He is very willing and such a great dog.\n\nA BIG FENCED YARD FOR HIM TO RUN AROUND AND PLAY IS A MUST!",

He is by all means a goofy, energetic lab with the sweetest smile and a glint in his eyes that could melt snow. He's a natural athlete that can clear a 6 foot fence and will run his own personal marathon were a door to be cracked open. Because he is quite the physical specimen, he needs to be on a lead even in a fenced in yard. Jaxx would do best in a low key environment with no young children. He has lived with other dogs before and currently has foster fur sibilings; however, he must be fed separately due to guarding behaviors. These same behaviors mean that he should never be allotted bones or treats that last longer than a chew or two. With some time and patience invested in trust-building and consistent training, he could be the new best friend you're looking for. If you're ready to welcome Jaxx into your life and head on over to OurBestFriendsRescue.org and fill out an application today.\nJaxx is approx 40 lbs and is 4 years old. \n\nLocation: Greenwhich, NY\nAdoption Fee: $400",

She has a moderate activity level and LOVES to go in the yard and play tennis ball and wrestle with her large and small dog friends. Her best friends are all little dogs at the moment! Greta the Great walks well on a leash and is crate trained. She is so happy at all times, that it\u2019s impossible to be sad in her presence. Great would make a wonderful family dog.\n\n\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

This boy deserves better.  \n\nClous is believed to be 11 years old and is a pit mix.  We think he is mixed with a Shar-pei.  Check out that cute wringly forehead!  Clous is a chill fella.  He walks well on a leash and rides well in the car.  He also sits for treats and takes them like a gentleman.  Clous loves neck scratches.  They are his favorite!   Clous is currently in foster with one of our volunteers.  She reports that is just the best boy!  He loves to go for walks and pays no mind to the cat.  \n\nIf you are interested in being his forever home, please visit our website, www.crcpa.org, and complete an application for Clous!  \n\nUpdate:  Clous had a tumor removed.  He is healthy but the vet recommends a wellness check ups every three months.",

Greer's favorite thing in the whole entire world is playing with stuffed toys. He'll carry them around in his mouth and leap in the air to catch them. Greer can be a little unsure when meeting new people, but given appropriate time and space, he adjusts quickly. Once he trust you, Greer enjoys being around people and even gets excited when you give him your attention and affection. Greer is a smart kiddo who learns quickly through force-free, science-based training methods. He would love to use his keen brain to solve food puzzles or learn new skills. Greer can be selective about his dog friends and would do best as the only dog in the home, or with a mature, neutral dog who will allow Greer time and space to get acclimated. Greer would do best with a family that has dog experience and is ready to commit to helping Greer be his best self! When Greer's needs are met, he's an absolute gem of a dog who is sure to bring laughter, joy, and love to your life.",

He will be arriving to AHR from our rescue partner in Louisiana, along with his brother Shawn.  \n\nLike a typical four month old puppy, Shane is working on his training, leash skills, house and crate training.  \n\n We are looking for experienced families who are knowledgeable with this breed, who are willing to spend the time, money and energy to raise a well balanced dog who will be a good citizen. These puppies will not be adopted as first come first take, they will be placed appropriately\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nFOR PUPPIES: PLEASE READ!!\nHomes considering Puppies must be prepared for:\nFlexible Schedules for Potty Training. Puppies can only hold urine for one hour per month of age. Crate Training for the next 10 months to keep them safe from chewing on everything in your home. Supervision with Children and Obedience training. \nSocialization; both with new people, children and other dogs outside of the home.\nHomes that want a well behaved dog, must be prepared to put the time, effort and costs associated to train a puppy. Well behaved dogs are not born, they are trained!  Please do not apply for a puppy if you cannot or do not have the time for a puppy.\n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n\n",

I will calmly sit for an hour in your lap receiving pets but the first 10 minutes I'm going to be tense. I'm cautious but curious and want to trust again. I required hip surgery and the vet says I'm healing well. Even before the surgery the injury was not slowing me down any. I was happy to chase and tackle my 60lb friend but we had be supervised so I didn't get hurt. I'm a mature puppy. I love to play with toys independently but I'm still learning what is approved for me to play with. I'm learning to walk on a leash. I love that it lets me explore safely but as soon as I feel a little tug I freak out some. My foster mom thinks I'm overly dramatic in these situations but I'm just trying to make sure I'm safe and not hurt. I look forward to having a forever home and I'm willing to share affection with other pets. My adoption fee is $250 Houston area\n(Available for transport $550, includes adoption fee, health certificate, and transportation)\nand includes all my vaccinations, microchip, and neuter.

Shawn and his brother Shane will be arriving to us from our partner rescue in Louisiana.  \n\nShawn was recently rescued from a shelter in Louisiana and is working on his training.  He is currently working on leash training, house and crate training.  \n\n**We are looking for experienced families who are knowledgeable with this breed, who are willing to spend the time, money and energy to raise a well balanced dog who will be a good citizen. These puppies will not be adopted as first come first take, they will be placed appropriately\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nFOR PUPPIES: PLEASE READ!!\nHomes considering Puppies must be prepared for:\nFlexible Schedules for Potty Training. Puppies can only hold urine for one hour per month of age. Crate Training for the next 10 months to keep them safe from chewing on everything in your home. Supervision with Children and Obedience training. \nSocialization; both with new people, children and other dogs outside of the home.\nHomes that want a well behaved dog, must be prepared to put the time, effort and costs associated to train a puppy. Well behaved dogs are not born, they are trained!  Please do not apply for a puppy if you cannot or do not have the time for a puppy.\n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption.

I am a very sweet and cuddly dog who loves to snuggle up in bed with the people that I love. I also love to be outside and go for long walks or runs! I love people, including young children, and am always super friendly when I meet new friends. I get along well with other dogs and animals as long as we are in situations in which there is no food present. So I may be the type of pup that you can bring out and about to socialize with other dogs, but I should always remain the only dog in the home to avoid any bad interactions due to food aggressiveness. I have never lived with a feline companion but I do appear to be fearful of them and would ask that any possible introductions be done very gradually. I am well-trained, including potty-trained, and know a few important commands. I'm not one to bark much and I've never been known to be a chewer either. I'm really a very sweet dog that just needs to be the queen of my own castle!",

Dutch spent the majority of his short life in the shelter system so he would greatly benefit from a home that is willing to provide structure, training, exercise and of course lot's of love! He would do best with an experienced dog owner. Although, he has gotten along with most dogs, we do recommend him being the only pet. \nDutch is an awesome pup who has great potential! \n\n",

May looks to her sister for clues on what to do, so obviously April is more confident in whatever is happening. May remains scared and confused so our staff has been working to try to convince her that everything is okay. But in her mind, it's not okay and she is watchful from the back of her kennel. A great deal of patience is going to be needed to help her relax. But by looking at the most recent picture of her, you can easily see a pretty relaxed dog standing in our play yard! Recently volunteers have reported that May is much braver when April is around and then May will wag her tail and allow some petting. As time goes by, we will update our progress with what we know can be a sweet dog! Learn more about our virtual adoption process .",

When his owner passed away, he came to rescue and is now enjoying his new life as a pampered indoor pet and has taken to it quite nicely.   Beethoven is heartworm positive, and seems to have chronic ear infections - all of which are treatable!    He likes to sleep a lot, and is good with other dogs.  Beethoven is not neutered, and wants others to know he\u2019s there so had a tendency to mark but with some work this can be resolved.   He is not a big guy at 60 lbs  and would be perfect for someone looking for that awsome Saint personality  in a smaller package..  He is looking for his forever home to live out his remaining years - are you that home?  \n",

She is also good with other dogs of all sizes. She does however prefer to have her food bowl to herself, so potential adopters should plan to feed separately. Rory would enjoy a home with a nice backyard to play in and someone who would like to go on short walks. She enjoys going on car rides and wanted us to put in that she would love to go to McDonalds every once in a while for chicken nuggets.\n\nAll dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project will be up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered (age appropriate), and heartworm negative before adoption.

He is the perfect age because he is out of the puppy stage, but still young enough to still be energetic and trainable.\n\nTux is a lover. He loves his people with everything he has. Tux delights in giving hugs and enjoys getting back rubs. He likes his toys and takes care of them. There is no tearing through toys with this guy! He would love a soft bed to spend his nights on and he promises not to mess it up!\n\nTux is best suited for a home with no other pets. He absolutely loves people and would fit right into any home, whether it be a single person, couple or family.\n\nAll dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered (age appropriate), and heartworm negative. All dogs are given monthly flea/tick preventative, monthly heartworm preventative, and are dewormed regularly. Dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are microchipped. Adoption fee is $50. Home visit and vet reference required. Applications can be put in online at http://www.troyanimalrescueproject.org/adopt.php or in person at our rescue center.\n\nThe address for our rescue center is 34 County Road 2266, Brundidge, AL 36010.

            "description": "Meet Cairo. She was rescued from a kill shelter and placed in a foster home. In the few short weeks she has been there, this girl has been nothing short of amazing. She is so insanely sweet, gets along great with other dogs, is good with the cat, walks on a leash, is house broken and crate trained. She hung out with a little 2 year old boy and she seemed to enjoy him. She is still learning how to be a carefree dog but is making great progress. She is very shy and will melt into the floor when approached in hopes the person will be kind and loving to her. She is a big time snuggle bug and is happy to be cuddled up on the couch with her human or a furry friend. She is so insanely sweet and loving that its hard for her foster humans to believe someone ever let this sweet pup end up at the kill shelter. Because she is so shy, it would be best for her to be in a home with another dog that can continue to show her how to be a dog. She would also benefit from a home with a fenced in yard or a more active lifestyle as she loves to go for walks and runs.\n\nAll dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project will be up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered (age appropriate), and heartworm negative before adoption. All dogs are given monthly flea/tick preventative, monthly heartworm preventative, and are dewormed regularly. Dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are microchipped. Adoption fee is $50. Home visit and vet reference required. Applications can be put in online at http://www.troyanimalrescueproject.org/adopt.php or in person at our rescue center. ***WE DO NOT DO SAME DAY ADOPTIONS***\n\nThe address for our rescue center is 34 County Road 2266, Brundidge, AL 36010. We are one turn off Hwy 167. If you use Google maps, type in Troy Animal Rescue Project and it will take you right to us. Hours of operation are from 11-3 daily. We are open Saturdays and Sundays. No appointment necessary for pets that are located at the rescue center. Appointments must be made to visit pets in foster homes. Appointments can be made by calling 334-508-2367 or emailing troyanimalrescueproject@gmail.com. Location information will be listed beside the pets name if they are at a location other than our rescue center.\n\nQuestions can be emailed to troyanimalrescueproject@gmail.com or call 334-508-2367.",

Welcome the Cutie Pie Pups - chock full of fluffy morsels to tempt your sweet tooth! Indulge today!\n\nHello! My name is Felix (which, in Latin, means \"successful\" and \"lucky\")! As a MatchDog, I feel like I'm a little of both! I, like a famous chef Marc Felix, have overcome obstacles and are now on the track to success. A 4-month-old Blue Heeler/Lab blend WEIGHING 23 POUNDS, I am crate trained and working on my house manners. Being an intelligent boy, I'll have no trouble figuring it all out.

He loves getting back scratches and being loved on. He is a loyal, friendly, smart boy. Memphis has done well with other dogs his size, and older kids. A fenced in yard is preferred for Memphis. If you would like to make Memphis a part of your family, please fill out an adoption application at www.barktownrescue.org\n\nAdoption Fee: $170\n\n*Due to Covid 19 restrictions some of our new intakes vet scheduling has been delayed. We will still go ahead and schedule your meet and greet even if all the vetting needed has not been completed. Once vetting is complete the approved adopter will be able to take their dog/cat home to their forever home.The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

ALL of our dogs reside in foster homes in the greater Pittsburgh, PA area. \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer organization. Please respect our volunteers' time. If a dog is listed on PetFinder, he/she IS available for adoption. We cannot reply to messages, phone calls, and emails about a dog until we have received, reviewed, and approved an adoption application. \n\nOur ADOPTION application is found at www.seniorhearts.org Completing this application is the first step in our adoption screening process. You MUST complete the application in its entirety in order to be considered as a potential adopter.  Please select \"More About Us\" for further details on our adoption requirements.  You can meet a dog ONLY after we have completed our adoption approval process.\n\nIf you are looking at the dog below, it most certainly means the dog is available for adoption. We look forward to receiving your application in hopes that you are able to meet our adoption requirements and provide this dog with a loving furever home.\n\nGood evening world! My name is Cleo and I have just begun a search for my furever family.  I am a 12-year-old beagle and weigh 24 pounds.  I am a pretty chill kinda girl.  I love going for walks and sniffing everything so sometimes we don't get too far because of my darn nose.  It would be awesome to have a backyard so I could sniff away.\n\nI am very friendly and get along with all dogs cats and humans.  I am an easy-going companion that is happy as can be hanging next to my human and watching Netflix.  A dog sibling would be great but definitely not needed for me.  \n\nIf we end up together I promise all the unconditional love you can handle. I can be adopted within a two-hour radius of Pittsburgh, PA. If you are interested in giving me a furever home, you must first complete the adoption application at www.seniorhearts.org\n",

            "description": "My name is Sarah, I have been bounced around and am looking for a forever home.  I need a home that has a great understanding of the husky breed.  I moved from CA to WA about a year ago.  I am 5 years old, but have tons of energy and act like I am one. \nI love to play and run all day long. I get so excited that I forgot my manners and will accidentally run you over. \nI am also not your average husky. I am a husky mix, most likely with malamute which makes me a 60-70 lb dog. I have very pretty long hair but I am stubborn about being brushed. It feels so good after a couple swipes. I have to go run and snort. Oh yeah I make lots of funny noises and guarantee will make you laugh. \nI need a home with a good secured fenced yard where I can run. My rescuers are asking for no small children due to my manners aren't the greatest. Absolutely NO small animals. I don't know what it is about them but I don't like them. They are funny looking to me. \nI need someone that can take me on regular walks and spend time with me and help me work on my manners. My foster mom has helped me greatly but there is still room for improvement. I would really like to be the only dog but I might accept a nice male dog that is around my size and age and can play just as hard as I do.\"  Please contact nwsnowdogrescue@aol.com\n",

            "description": "Meet medium size and medium energy Brock who would love a serene and calm place to retire.  Brock was adopted over 6 years ago after he was rescued by RCR and transported from a high kill shelter in Georgia to Washington state.  Sadly, now 8-year-old Brock is again looking for his forever home as his owner of 6 years has a new girlfriend who doesn\u2019t like Brock.  Jack Russell mix Brock is back with his former foster in Moses Lake while he awaits a patient and loving adopter who has no other pets or children. Brock weighs just 28lbs and is still as active and playful as he was years ago. He\u2019s had a lot of changes lately, so Brock needs an adopter who is knowledgeable about fearful dogs and who is willing to give him time to adjust. Brock is skittish and reactive to loud noises and sudden moves. He likes daily walks and needs an enclosed, fenced in yard. Brock is a pretty calm boy once he feels comfortable with you and will gladly be a couch potato with you or more likely your lap warmer. If you give him the ability and space to choose the amount and type of interaction he wants, he thrives!  Brock craves attention and loves to snuggle. He would love to be with a single person who is without kids and is not away from home for too many hours a day.  Brock is totally house trained and crate-trained. He gets along well with other dogs after proper intros, but really just prefers being with you, his people! Brock happily sleeps and hangs out in his crate.  Brock is very food motivated and is very smart.  He knows his basic commands and sits before going in a door and on command. He is also quite good with \u201cstay\u201d and will give you his \u201cpaw\u201d. Brock LOVES squeaker toys! Loud and sudden noises seem to remind him of his past and startle him which makes us assume it wasn't a very happy past. This is Brock\u2019s last chance at finding an experienced and caring adopter who can make Brock the center of their world. We are hoping that we can find Brock a home that will guarantee him a happy future. Brock's adoption fee is $150 and he is neutered, micro-chipped and fully-vaccinated.  For questions and a conversation with his foster mom Lindsey, please email rcrlindsey@gmail.com. Brock is currently being fostered in Moses Lake, WA. To complete an application, go to www.raincityrescue.com/adopt.  Best boy Brock might be a bit complicated, but if you need a project and to help save a life- Brock will be totally worth your time to check out.  He will repay you with kisses and loves and gratitude forever!",

He\u2019s a fun, loving dog who enjoys playing with his toys, running around the yard, exploring, and going for walks. As much as Mac appreciates playtime and keeping active, he enjoys relaxing just as much once it\u2019s time to do so.\n\nHere\u2019s Mac in a nutshell\u2026\n\nHe\u2019s a sensitive guy who wears his heart on his sleeve. He LOVES being around his people!\nAbout 45 pounds and 2-4 years old\nLoves to run around and would enjoy a yard in his new home, although this is not a requirement\nVery active but also likes to chill when it\u2019s time to do so. He can be your adventure and cuddle buddy all in one!\nDoes well with other dogs and has a rough play style. Mac would likely do fine with another dog in the home who could match his playstyle, but he would also love to be your one & only and we would prefer that for him, too!\nFoster dad describes him as a truly special guy who makes a fantastic companion with his great personality and his sense of humor. \n\n\nMac is updated on all vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped. If you are interested in adding this darling boy to your crew, please fill out an adoption application at https://form.jotform.com/92017020417141 or send us an email at noarcfosteradopt@gmail.com with any questions. Mac can\u2019t wait to meet you!\n\nFor information on how our adoption process works, please visit our website at www.thenoarc.com\n\nPlease note: prospective adopters must be located within the state of Ohio OR within 3 hours of Columbus, Ohio.\n\nAlso note that while we welcome questions from prospective adopters, it is much easier for us to fully answer questions and provide guidance if an adoption application has been filled out.\n\n**If this posting is up, Mac is still available for adoption :)**",

            "description": "Hello everyone! Abby here. I'm a 3-legged firecracker with an independent spirit packed into my 8 lb body.  At 9 years young, I am full of life, and while I do need help with stairs or to get in your lap for a quick snuggle, I can hold my own. My vision and hearing are slipping a bit so please make sure that any stairs are safeguarded. When you\u2019re in the kitchen cooking, I like to try and trip you up, so watch your step \u2014 I gotta be where the action is, after all! My favorite pastime is sleeping in the dog beds and trust me, I've got this down to a science. My foster dad takes me outside every time I wake up, and I do my business with efficiency and am ready to get back inside. My potty habits are a work in progress so please be patient with me. I'm a really sweet gal that just wants to be pampered throughout my golden years. I'm quiet and don\u2019t need a lot of space so either a home or apartment will suit me just fine. I have been diagnosed with bronchial malacia, my bronchial tubes coming off my esophagus are narrow and deformed causing me to cough. We are trying different medications to see what will work best for me, but I may need to be on medication the rest of my life. If you are ready to welcome a sleeping beauty into your home, fill out an application. Abby is spayed, up to date on all vaccines, had a heart worm test, on heartworm preventative, had a fecal, a dental, and microchipped. Abby\u2019s adoption fee is $275.00.",

I am an 8 yr old, 12 lb Chihuahua.\n\n- A little backstory...my sweet mama got Alzheimer's and was unable to care for me so our neighbor did everything she could to find me a new home but ended up taking me to the shelter where the lovely HIT Wives rescued me!\n\n- I am a GEM of a boy. I can be a little shy at first, but just wants to be loved and I will jump in people\u2019s laps for affection within about three minutes of meeting them! \n\n- I am a very easy, low maintenance boy to have. I don't chew nor dig, I take treats gently, and don't ever beg. I am a really sweet boy, good with everyone, who needs to be cherished and loved. \n\n- I am generally a medium energy dog. I don't need a lot of activity, but I do love my walks!\n\n- Sitting on laps is my favorite. So much so that I often fall asleep there :) Who doesn't love cuddling? \n\n- I am good with other dogs, am FULLY house trained, and just had a bunch'o teeth removed so give me all of the soft and yummy treats please!\n\n- I always want to be with you! Separation anxiety is something I'm learning to work through and already getting much better, and I will need a patient individual or family to help me overcome it and not feel like I am getting abandoned every time you leave. My foster mom is helping me lots and says that now when she leaves she hears me bark for a little, and then I stop and go settle down. \n\n- I am ready for my forever home and to get alllll the love I deserve!!! \n\nIf you see me online I am still available for adoption! If you are interested in adopting me please fill out an application here: www.hitlivingfoundation.org/adoption-application, and email a video walkthrough of your home and yard to BOTH Nicole@hitlivingfoundation.org AND Marta@hitlivingfoundation.org. Your application will not be counted as valid without your video. You will hear back from us within a few days.",

            "description": "ADOPTION OF A PUPPY UNDER 9 MONTHS OF AGE\n\nThe dog you are interested in is a puppy (under a year old). We have criteria for our adoptions of puppies. Puppies are adopted on a foster-to-adopt basis until the puppy is old enough to be neutered/spayed (we prefer them to be no younger than 7 months for females and 9 months for males). Houses with pools must demonstrate that puppies can be protected from the pool with fencing or a cover. Home visits for shots will be required, so puppies are adopted to homes in Maricopa County only. Puppies often have multiple potential adopters, so SPR evaluates what home is best matched with any given puppy and their expected home needs once they have grown.\n\nLucy is an energetic puppy that loves everyone. She gets along with other dogs and kids, but is still learning not to jump, so she will need a family willing to help keep training her. She is a fast learner and is already potty trained and knows sit, lay down, and stay. Even though her knickname is the mini Mal, due to her petite size, she loves playing with her bigger foster brothers and smaller foster sister. We recommend that she goes to a home with another dog to play with.. She\u2019s ready for a loving forever home!\n\n\nIf you can give Lucy  an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \n\n We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organization.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving the life of a puppy and providing for it's FOREVER home.",

He was a big mass of black matted fur and kind of looked like he would be a fluffy type of pup. To our amazement, once the matted fur was shaved off, there stood the cutest little chubby Scottish Terrier!!!!! \nThis poor little boy had been so neglected and on top of barely being able to move his head without pain from the mats, he had horrible ear infections. We\u2019ve had them treated and he\u2019s starting to feel much better now. We will have them rechecked around January 11th to make sure he\u2019s doing well. We got him too late to help his one ear that had a hematoma at some time but the other ear is pure Scottie. \nBuster is a little love bug who wants nothing more than a lap and lots of love. He does need to have his food monitored as he is a chow hound and will eat until he explodes if you let him. He is a small Scottie but at 15lbs is still in need of losing about 2lbs. \nBuster is afraid of leash walking but is getting better with a little practice. He\u2019s great on car rides and is really very easy going. \nIf you\u2019re looking for a sweet little man to spend your time with, he\u2019s your guy! \nBuster is located in Freeport NY\nHis adoption fee is $550\nWe do not have any way to cat test our pups. Please do not ask! If other animals are in a prospective adoptive home a meet and greet must be done. Applications do not guarantee you will get the dog you are applying for. \nPlease be patient after you\u2019ve sent in an app on a dog. This is an all-volunteer organization, everyone works and has families. This is done in our not so spare time.\n",

He's smart, agile, a very quick learner, and like most small Terriers, he needs a confident human that understands the Terrier breed so that he doesn't have to take charge.\nLicorice would love to hike or go with his human biking, and needs at least a long walk daily. He is house trained, crate trained and good on the leash. Licorice would excel at agility training and loves to learn and please. He'd love another dog to play with too!\nHis adoption fee is $250.00 and includes his neuter, current vaccinations and microchip. For profile with an adoption application, visit https://spotsavespets.org/dogs-n-puppies/\nTo follow Licorice on his way to a loving family on SPOT's Facebook page, visit https://facebook.com/spotsavespets/",

Both eyes needed surgery for cherry eye plus he's heart worm positive.\n\nCurrently at our vets office being medically cared for, Billy will be ready for a home by the middle of February.

I don't always have the best manners when I meet other dogs or people. I try really hard but I just get so excited to play that I forget to introduce myself properly. I definitely like to be super active...like all day! No lazy dog here! Don't get me wrong, I will snuggle and cuddle and I don't shed bad, but I want to be where the action is! I do like having alot of attention also!  I am probably not good around small kids. I can get along with other dogs, but it has to be an extremely laid back dog or a super active one that can try and keep up with me. I can be a little hard headed, but that's because I've been on my own for a while now. I am really ready to have a big yard of my own and people who are patient with me as I work on my manners. I love to fetch and run and play games! I am super smart and can find my treats in those silly games my foster humans got for me! I'm ready for a real challenge!",

I love to play with my furry friends but I come on strong and excited and not all dogs like me so I would do best as an only dog in the home just to be safe. I'm told I'm 1 1/2 years old, neutered, up to date on shots, and microchipped, whatever that means. I'm just ready to play or taking a walk sounds nice. Game of catch? I'm up for anything fun.\n\nI'm currently being fostered in Houston, TX. The nice people that are helping me find a new family have adopted to many happy people in your area and can provide references. They even use this amazing ground transport that goes to the PNW twice a month\n\nWant to learn more about me? Email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com or fill out an application on their webiste www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 and they will get us in touch. I guess that means we're going to be best friends FOREVER! Can't wait to meet you.",

I even howl when I get really happy-- I nearly say my name, ROL-LO!. Staff says I really enjoy my walks and yes, I loves those toys. I'm a good boy and I come out of my aloof shell quite quickly. I'm easy-going around other dogs. I currently weigh in at 61lbs and qualify for the senior adoption rate of $35. This fella currently had a nice over-night visit with a volunteer's family and did well with the neighbor cat, the 5 year old child in the home and even ignored the chickens following behind him as they went on a walk on the property.

            "description": "The Beagle personality is marked by a bold and cheerful disposition.  They are avid working dogs that combine intense drive and cuddly good looks into an adorable package.\n\nThese curious dogs take in their environment through their nose, and they\u2019re often found scenting as if magnetized to the ground. This natural tendency to sniff can make it challenging to keep a Beagle\u2019s attention, and if a scent is too tempting to resist, many Beagles are prone to take off without a backward glance. For this reason, it\u2019s suggested that Beagles only be off leash in fenced areas.\n\nBecause of their friendly attitude Beagles are good family dogs. They\u2019re cheerful and clever and can be a fantastic match for families that are able to meet their exercise needs. Beagles are generally very good with kids who understand how to interact with and handle dogs.\n\nMEET OUR BEAGLE- RICKY!   Around four years old, Ricky found himself in a shelter in South Carolina for three months with no one wanting him.  We believe this is because hounds in the southern shelters are plentiful AND because he was heart worm positive.   The cost to treat can easily deter an adopter.  So, lucky for Ricky Di fell in love with him and, as a holiday present, he was her rescued dog that she vetted and shared with our rescue to re-home.\n\nHe has not been fully vetted and is available for adoption.  Although currently in NC at our vets office, we will transport to an approved adopter.  You can find an online application on our webpage, http://diamonddogsrescueinc.com",

He will need to find a comfortable quiet, but active home that will show him the good life!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, and would like to make an appointment for a meet and greet, please fill out and submit our Canine Adoption Application on our website:\n\nhttps://www.apsfh.com/adoption-program/canine-application/\n\nCOVID-19: Due to the ongoing pandemic, APS-FH will be giving priority to local adopters, however an application must be submitted prior to any meet and greets.",

            "description": "Kobi and his companion Bella were found exploring the neighborhood after their fencing fell down.\n\nWhen their owner was contacted, they stated they couldn\u2019t afford to pay the fees to get them out of the shelter, so they abandoned them there.\n\nBella had healing wounds around her neck, most likely from being chained or tethered.  Both were underweight and in rough shape though Kobi seems to have fared better physically.\n\nWe are having Bella examined by our vet before she's made available.\n\nDespite the neglect they endured, both of them are overflowing with love and affection, which they seemed to have been deprived of.  \n\nKobi is just a youngster at approx 1 year old with a whole lot of growing to do!  He\u2019s a already a big, strong boy with an unbridled sense of adventure.\n\nHe fires on all cylinders and is eager to get out and see the world.  We can\u2019t blame him for his enthusiasm, if he\u2019s been isolated in a yard his whole life.\n\nHe could be mixed with German Shepherd or a combination of other breeds, but nonetheless he\u2019s a friendly, outgoing, lover.  He enjoys meeting new people and doesn\u2019t know the meaning of \u201caloof\u201d!  To the contrary, he can be a bit overzealous when greeting people so will need to learn proper etiquette!\n\nKobi will be enrolled in a basic obedience and manners class before he\u2019s available, so he can be the best he can be!  His new owner will need to continue implementing his training and socialization as part of his daily routine as he matures and grows.\n\nHis ideal guardian is someone who is active and maybe even likes to run and hike.  You should be an experienced large breed individual who is familiar with setting boundaries and maintaining rules.\n\nKobi will require a home with a large fenced yard.  No apartments or townhouses will be considered. \n\nNo children in his future home as he is much too big and energetic for little humans.\n\nIt might be the mix in him, as Kobi is not a typical Akita and seems to be quite social with many other well mannered dogs his size.  He may do well with an appropriately matched female of equal activity level.\n\nCheck back for updates as we get better acquainted with Kobi. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our adoption application found on our website here:  https://www.namasteakitarescue.com/how-do-i-adopt\n\nThere you will find helpful information about the adoption process, FAQ's, etc\n\n\n**PLEASE NOTE, we must first approve an application before a meeting can be arranged between a prospective adopter and our dogs.\n\nPlease email us for additional information or if you have questions: info@namasteakitarescue.com\n",

            "description": "Daisee is a 3 year old spayed female pit bull/bulldog mix who weighs about 50 lbs. Daisee was rescued from a high kill shelter after being found as a stray with a horrible leg injury. Despite the pain and discomfort she must have been in, Daisee has been an absolute sweetheart from the moment we met her. She has been receiving treatment for her leg and has been a wonderful patient. She seems to be so thankful for all the attention and care we've been giving her. This girl has the most beautiful blue brindle coat that feels like velvet. She loves to be with her people and spending time outside. Daisee is still working on her training and will need an experienced and dedicated family that will be consistent and provide positive reinforcement so she can continue to learn and grow. She doesn't seem comfortable around children, so she will need a home without them. Daisee loves to play, but has a medium energy level overall. She's done well with dogs she has met, and even seemed okay with cats. After everything she's been through, Daisee is so deserving of an amazing home that will give her all the love and attention she wants. She is sure to repay the favor ten-fold! Please help us find Daisee the forever family she is dreaming of!\n\nInterested in adopting?

As I was a street dog most of my live, not many people have been nice to me, and I\u2019ve had to scrounge around for food. Therefore, I do have some trust issues and am wary of strangers. I am better with women. However, once you win me over, I am a big cuddle bug and will be forever loyal to you! Furthermore, due to my time on the streets, I would not like humans or animals to disturb me while I am eating. It is best to separate me while I am eating and let me be alone. I am currently at a wonderful lady\u2019s house who is training me to mind my space and focus on my leader. I love treats and cuddles. I realize I am not as easy as some other dogs. However, if you give me a chance, with the right person, I will be the most loyal and happy lap dog.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pooch, please download the Adoption Questionnaire (farescue.org/pdf_files/questionnaire_canine.pdf), fill it out and email it back to us at info@farescue.org or fax (310) 362-0321. You can also meet this and/or other available dogs at our weekend adoptions.\n\n[Playa is 2 years old and weighs 36 lbs.]\n\n(2101)\n\n",

            "description": "Snow\n1.5 yr old lab/shepherd mix\n\nSnow came from Nemaska, Quebec with her six puppies through IFAW\u2019s Northern Dog Project. She was a great mama to all of her babies. Now that they\u2019ve all been adopted, it\u2019s time for her to find a forever family of her own.\nSnow needed time to warm up to the resident dogs in her foster family as she was initially protective of her puppies, but once she realized they posed no threat she allowed them into her social bubble and even accepted their help raising her puppies. They are now best of friends. She plays very well with the male dog and follows the rules set out by the senior small dog in her foster home. She likes to be close to her humans and especially likes to rest her head in your lap and snuggle up close. Snow LOVES to play ball. She is incredibly agile and driven. She is a great jumper so a secure fence is important, but she prefers to go on walks to take care of her business so a backyard is not essential for her. She has a strong prey drive towards squirrels and rabbits while on walks, but responds well to redirection with verbal cues and treats. Due to lockdown restrictions, we have been unable to test her with cats.\nSnow would do best with another active, playful dog in the home. She will otherwise require a very active human who will take her on long walks, hikes, and runs to make sure she has an opportunity to drain her energy and to keep her body and mind active. She has been very good with the people she has met since coming into foster care, but her interactions have been limited due to lockdown. She is working on basic obedience and manners in her foster home. Adolescent obedience classes would be beneficial for her and her new family. Snow is house-trained and crate-trained, but has been free roaming in her foster home since her puppies were weaned.\n\nSnow has been a lovely addition to her foster family. She fits in well with everyone and is eager to please. If you\u2019re looking for a smart, loyal, and affectionate sidekick, Snow would love to meet you! \n\nSnow has been vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, spayed, heartworm tested and treated with Advantage Multi\n\nThe adoption fee is $600 and includes spay/neuter (dogs over 6 months), vaccines, heartworm test (dogs over 6 months), deworming, Flea and tick prevention and microchip. Please visit www.paws-united.com to fill out an application.\n**For puppies under 6 months a $200 spay/neuter rebate will be given with proof of spay/neuter certificate signed by a vet, if they have not been done prior to adoption.**\n**Please note we DO NOT adopt our dogs as outdoor/farm dogs. These dogs are coming to us as stray, roaming or dogs that have lived a life tied to a chain. Our goal is to bring them in the house off the chain and give them a pampered indoor dogs lifestyle. Unless otherwise stated we will not even consider a home that has intentions of leaving our dogs outdoors or tied to a chain**",

It means \u201cbeautiful\u201d, which, if I do say so myself, suits me perfectly! I\u2019m an independent lady, who likes doing her own thing. I enjoy being in the presence of people, but I won\u2019t beg for attention. I\u2019m not a fan of cuddling. I\u2019m a bit skittish, so for that reason I cannot go to a home with young children. I might do better with older kids who can understand that I like having my space. I\u2019m not very energetic, but I do love playing with toys. I like chasing balls and swinging around a rope toy. Once I\u2019ve gotten my playtime in, I enjoy just lying around and relaxing. I need help learning to walk nicely on leash so I need a proper harness and some training. I don't like bunnies in my yard, so if you adopt me, please bunny-proof your yard! If I sound like the girl for you, please ask about me today!\n\nLeash: Needs work\nObedience: Knows basic skills like sit, stay, lie down!\nContainment: A fenced in yard\nWith other Dogs: Unknown\nWith cats: Unknown\nWith small children: Not suitable\n\nAdoption comes with:\n\n* Mandatory spaying/neutering\n* First license\n* Veterinarian check-up\n* First vaccinations\n* Tattoo\n* Microchip implant\n* 6 weeks of free pet insurance\n* Small bag of dog food\n* De-worming for young pups\n * Literature on responsible pet ownership.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n** IMPORTANT NOTICE **\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, dog adoptions are currently being done by appointment only. Contact 311 to schedule an appointment. Thank you!\n\n______________________________\n\nCome Meet Our Adoptable Dogs...\nWinnipeg Animal Services Agency\n1057 Logan Avenue\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\nR3E 3N8\n\nPhone: 311 - outside Winnipeg dial 1-877-311-4974 \n\nEmail: animalservicesagency@winnipeg.ca\n\nOur hours for adoption are Monday to Friday from 11:00 am - 5:30 pm\nSaturday & Sunday from 12:00 pm - 4:30pm.\nAnimal Services is closed on statutory holidays.\n\nBACKGROUND\nAlmost all the dogs at Animal Services are picked up as strays running loose on the streets of Winnipeg and therefore they come to us with no known history. For this reason, we are not sure how they will interact with other dogs, cats or how they are with children. We would suggest that if you have younger children you bring them down with you to meet the dogs. We also have an outdoor play area where we can do introductions with any other dogs that live in the home.\n\nAll locally adopted dogs come with a 7 day home trial. If you return the dog within this time period, you will be refunded your adoption fee less the non-refundable deposit.\n\nPlease feel free to meet all the dogs and puppies outside of their kennels, just let the kennel attendants know that you would like a meet and greet with the dog outside of his pen. The dogs are much more relaxed when outside of their kennels. They would love to meet you!",

            "description": "Judy was surrendered by her family along with an adult male and their four puppies... where they were living outdoors. She was a good mom but after they got big enough she was more than happy to detach herself from them haha. We have spent the last few weeks getting to know her and learn the best home environment for her. She is a very happy and very playful girl.. she loves to chew on bones, chase toys, and love on people. Judy is 2 years old but is still learning appropriate behaviors since she never lived indoors before. She would strongly benefit from a home willing to put time into her training by continuing to use positive reinforcement training that she is thriving with. \nAt this time we are suggesting a home with no toddler age or younger children, as well as no other animals. She is a very bossy female and since she grew up with the male dog she was surrendered with, he seems to tolerate it for the most part.\n\nJudy is a pint sized girl at 32lbs and a very petite stature.. her ears are probably the biggest thing about her and they can hear treat bags open from two rooms away - so Beware! :) She is fully vetted, fixed and has no medical issues to note.\n\nAdoption Process: PLEASE READ!\nJudy has a $300 adoption fee.\nAnyone interested in meeting our adoptables must complete an online application, which is located on our website. This site is updated weekly so if an animal is listed they are available for adoption. Once the application is approved we will set up a meet and greet with the animal to ensure a good fit and then before adoption is complete we will schedule a home check to ensure a safe environment for the animal you are looking to adopt. If you live outside of the Tri-County area we will do our best to accommodate a home visit but it will rely on the availability and volunteers at that time. At this time we cannot do out of the state adoptions. We also do not do on-the-spot adoptions and we do not adopt out animals by a first-come, first-serve basis. We strive to fit everyone of our animals to the best match possible! We pride ourselves in responsibly placing animals in homes that are best fit for their needs.\n\nwww.redemptionrescuemi.com",

She is calm and sweet and content to stay right with her people. She walks nicely on her leash, taking her time and checking out the yard or the block. She has gotten along well with everyone she\u2019s met and shares nicely with the other pets in her foster home, drinking from the communal water dish and curling up together on the blanket for naps.\n\nMaggie does need frequent potty breaks, so she would do best in a home where someone can take her out every couple of hours. She is happy to use her crate at night or for shorter daytime naps. Her ideal Forever Home would be a quieter one. Though she is friendly with visitors, she is an older lady who would not be up to the activity level of young children. And although she has gotten along fine with her foster brother, she needs a lot of individual attention and would be fine as an only dog or possibly in a household with one other easygoing, older dog.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is TEAL and I would love to meet you. I am a Spayed Female Pit Bull Terrier. The shelter staff think I am about 3 years old. I have been at the shelter since Dec 31, 2020. Meet Teal! This pocket pittie is slowly gaining her confidence in a loving foster home. Even though she is 3 years old, she is pure puppy in many ways and will need consistent, regular exercise to get out her HIGH ENERGY. Teal has an extreme desire to learn and would greatly appreciate agility training because of her bouncy athleticism. She really enjoys playing with toys and it helps her get out that indoor energy. She is slow to warm up to new people and will slink around a bit but just needs to learn how to trust you. Walks are a new adventure to her and will require patience so she can sniff out her surroundings. Teal is a very curious girl which overcomes her initial fear to new people and places. For more information about Teal, please email adoptions@thehumanesociety.org",

This time, one that will care for him!\n\nArchie is thought to be around 2 years old and a beagle mix.  He is such a sweet affectionate dog.  Loves his person and looks to please.  Because Beagles have traditionally been raised in large packs, they do not do well as a single pet, left alone all day. Their frustration will quickly lead to excessive barking and destructive behavior. A second dog for companionship is strongly recommended.\n\nOur basic medical is as follows:  DHLPP vaccines, Rabies vaccine, Influenza vaccine, Lyme vaccine.  4dx snap test to check-The test is a screening process for six vector-borne diseases.

If you live nearby or within driving distance, can you come to pick me up to go home with you?\n\nA nice person came along and took me in and, now, I am ready to hit the road to your house!  Uh, make that \u201cour\u201d house, OK?  I definitely need a house with a fenced-in yard cuz I need room to run and romp and be safe!  The rescue requires (1) a fenced-in yard and (2) a vet reference from a vet that you have used for a current or previous dog to be sure that all vetting was done.  \n\nI am a Corgi/Beagle mix, we think.  I am 5-years old and I weigh 20 pounds.  I have been neutered and am up to date on vaccines so I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU!!  Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures said I\u2019m also microchipped \u2013 whatever THAT is.  At any rate, I am fully vetted.  Is that anything close to petted?  I love to be petted!  They say I'm precious.  Hmmm, Is my name Shiloh or Precious?\n\nWanna hear some more good stuff about me?  OK, here goes.  I like ALL people and dogs.  I am sweet and playful.  I haven't been around children and I might very well be OK with them but let's hope for a home with just adults.  OK?\n\nI need my own home.  I'm still young enough to have a good, long life with you taking care of me and I'll take care of YOU!\n\nSince I was rescued, I've learned to use a doggie door at my foster's home.  Smart, huh? I like to take naps when I'm tired from playing.  I need  love, exercise and couch-sitting when we get tired!  Let's be a team, OK?\n\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email doggydarlings12@gmail.com  and they can get me on my way to a new and loving home!  My adoption fee is $150 and includes my vetting, neutering, and a microchip.\n",

My energy level is pretty ideal- I love going on walks (I walk well on a leash) but am just as happy to snooze. One thing you should know about me- I'm taking my medication to assist me with separation and storm anxiety. I prefer not to be crated and it would probably be best if you're able to be home much of the day. \n\n\n\nIf you would like to meet me please call our call center at 407.351.7722 to schedule an appointment.\n\nI am located in Sanford at 2800 County Home Rd Sanford, FL 32773.",

I still have a lot of pep in my step and would love to keep you company on little adventures.\nThe world is still a big and scary place so I prefer to hang out and snuggle up with my special family most days. \nI am mostly house broken, but am a gentleman about a rare accident and know where the pee pads are. Very young kids can be scary for me as well as the big strong men, but with love and patience I\u2019m always willing to give new people a try.\nI\u2019m a very good boy and truly want to settle down and spend my days Netflix and chillin\u2019.\nCould I be your man???\n\nThis pet's adoption fee is $325.

If you are interested in meeting any of our pets, please email us or fill out our online application. We can then review and send to the foster family. We may cancel our home visits as well but if you could attach photos of your yard and one or two of your home that would be great.

He has turned around completely with lots of love, good food and structure. Now he is happy in his big kennel and his fearfulness is almost gone.  Baxter has learned that people are kind and caring, so there is nothing to worry about. He LOVES to jump up and \"give hugs\" to his people, that can knock you over if you are not watching!\n \nBaxter will do best in an active, adult home with a fenced yard. He is house trained and crate trained, too. Because of his history of fearfulness, he will be better in a home without young children. We are looking for a new owner who has experience with large dogs.\n\nBaxter is vaccinated, neutered and microchipped. He will have heartworm treatment in January and be ready for adoption in February.\n\nYou are welcome to complete an adoption application for Baxter now, if you live in the DFW area. See our web site for information on our adoption process. Baxter's adoption fee is $295 + tax.  www.LoneStarLabRescue.org  \n\n*** IF THIS LISTING IS ACTIVE< BAXTER IS AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION  **\n** AVAILABLE IN FEBRUARY **",

            "description": "Benjamin is our beautiful work in progress!  Police dropped Ben off at a Philadelphia shelter after he was found injured and suffering from an awful skin condition.  He fully recovered in his foster home and has turned into a stunning boy.  At two years old he is full of life and loves to play.   In the evening he loves nothing more than to sprawl on the sofa with you and snuggle until bedtime. He sleeps peacefully in his crate at night although he\u2019d love to sleep in your bed! \nBen is an adolescent dog and loves to \"test the waters\", and since it was difficult to curb his jumping he is in training classes with a former canine police officer and he is a star pupil.  Ben is very smart and wants to please.  He has no aggression but he loves to play hard. He will do best in a home where he will be exercised faithfully with quality playtime and great walks. He is not aggressive in any way with other dogs or people but he wishes they would play the way he does.  He loves the attention he gets from people on his walks and he is fine having the neighborhood kids ride their bikes and scooters along with him.\nBen has three more sessions with his trainer.  In the meantime he is happy in his foster home as he waits for his happily ever after.  He will be placed in a home with pitbull experience, someone who will keep him on track,  and where he'll get the exercise he craves so much. Ben is not suited for apartment or condo living. He requires a fenced yard to work off his youthful exuberance.\nBen is fostered in Barnegat, NJ and is neutered and up to date with vaccinations. An adoption within a 40 mile radius is preferred.\nIf you think your family dynamic is a good match for Benjamin, please complete an application at www.pounddogfounddog.org.

At some point Lexie had two broken front legs that were never taken care of and healed however they healed. Lexie is super sweet, good with kids and other animals. She would probably do best in a quiet home where she can be lazy given the fact that she is around 7-8 years old and has leg issues. Lexie will most likely need supplements or arthritis meds at some point. She is spayed and vaccinated.  Please text 570-903-1731 with any questions or apply via the website. www.nepapetrescue.com.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nGryphon is an American bully/ hound mix (born around 2/20/20) that came to us from a really rough situation. He was first posted on an Alabama lost and found site as found. It was discovered he had owners. Luckily animal control was able to get him out and safe. He was suffering from extreme demeodex mange. He was also quite thin and had badly infected eyes. The infection was so bad it resulted in loss of one of them. But as you can see, Gryphon has healed amazingly well. Gryphon absolutely loves his people; his foster mom says he is always near her or within eye sight. He also loves all dogs and kitties. Doesn't matter the size he plays with everyone. He can be a little rough and rowdy with his play so he will need a playmate that can tolerate a little wrestling and who likes to play chase.\nHe is housebroken and kennel trained, but his foster mom does admit that he sleeps in bed with her at night. He would not do well in an apartment as sometimes he can be a bit vocal. He also will require a privacy fence as he can easily jump or scale a chain link, especially if it means getting to his person.\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Gryphon is $225and includes his neuter, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037. You may also send a message to our Amazing Grace Bully Rescue Page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or send an email directly to amazinggracebullyrescue@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer: We are located in the Pensacola, Florida area and will consider local applicants first, especially with puppies since we use a vet in the local area.",

My previous home had other dogs and I just did not do well with a crowd. I might be ok with another male large dog but honestly, I'd love to be the only \"furchild\" in the home.\n\n I love kids but I can get a little over playful and might knock down a small child. Kids over age 10 would be best. My foster mom has taught me lots of fun things to do while I've been with her family. I really love going for bike rides attached by my springer and I even got to do a little scooter racing last fall. She thinks I would be really good at skijoring and maybe pulling a sled too. \n\nMy new home should be an active one as I have tons of energy to burn...you know the old saying.....\"a tired dog is a good dog!\". Short car rides are lots of fun, but my tummy gets a little upset on really long rides. My new home should have a fenced yard for me to play in and keeping me from exploring without a human. I also require plenty of tummy rubs!\n\nNote from the humans: June is being fostered at Few Steps From Home rescue and they will be handling her adoption. You can fill out a meet-n-greet application on their website   www.fewstepsfromhome.com or email them at:     dogrescue0146@gmail.com",

She was in rural MO living outside and she gave birth to several litters even though she was just a baby herself! She was pretty shy and nervous at first, she didn't know that people could be good and kind. But she is starting to realize that they can be and she is coming out of her shell. She truly is just the sweetest girl in the world and loves everyone -kids, dogs, and cats. With a little love she will make someone the most amazing companion.\n\nApproximate Birthdate: Aug 2018\n\nAdoption Fee: $150\n\nTARA's adoption fee includes: spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test (if age appropriate), heartworm and flea prevention, and deworming. TARA's pets are all eligible for a\n\ntwo week trial\n\n.\n\nDue to the fact that many of our dogs come from the local city shelters, we do not know the background of many of them and therefore cannot always guarantee age or breed. Size is subjective but we use the following guidelines: Small 1-20 pounds, Med 20-50 pounds, Large 50-80 pounds, Extra Large over 80 pounds.\n\nFor more information please fill out an APPLICATION\n\nPlease visit our\nEVENTS PAGE\nfor information about our upcoming adoption events.",

But before you rush to apply to take me home, you must know a few things about me.\n\nYou see, I was a matted mess when K9 took me in, they gave me a warm bath and trimmed my fur of knots & matts to show off my cute face. I'm a young lady, and I'm a bit timid, but once I get used to you, I will do zooms for hours! I like my foster siblings, they give me confidence & someone to play with. I really don't like to be alone, I'll be your shadow wherever you go. I love going for walks, toys, car rides, toys, treats, toys, snuggling up next to you, & did I mention treats & food. If you give me treats, I will love you forever! I'm really a happy and energetic pup. I don't bark, but I loooooove to be the center of attention. So if you're looking for a loyal sidekick, then I'm the one for you!\n\nPLEASE read the notes below from my foster mom:\n\nMAJOR NOTE: Ismay will need to be groomed regularly (she gets very shaggy). However, she is TERRIFIED of clippers, she will need a sedative/anti-anxiety medication to help her as she gets used to it.\n\n- Ismay really needs someone that is around. She does NOT like being left alone, she wants to be around someone.\n\n- While she likes to be around people, she is still very skittish and unsure. She'll most times try to run away when you try to pet her. Requires patience as she learns she likes the pets and attention.\n\n- She would do well in a house with another dog that is confident and playful as she is energetic.\n\n- She absolutely does NOT enjoy being confined and cannot tolerate being in a crate as she has injured herself in the past while in one. She has been left free roam of our house for short periods of time and she has not torn up or damaged anything.\n\n- She is the sweetest, goofy pup, she just needs someones that will be patient with her as she learns that humans are nice.\n\nIsmay is a female Maltese/Havanese mix with est DOB of 08/12/19 and weighs approximately 12 pounds.",

            "description": "Barks and Meows Rescue introduces Taz. He is a Lab/Beagle mix. He weighs 59lbs and is 1 1/2 years old. Taz is not a tall dog. He was surrendered to a shelter from a gentleman that had a bunch of dogs, but the neighbors kept complaining so he signed over 5 of them to the shelter. He has a medium length hair coat. Taz is very sweet. He is timid when he meets new people so a quiet home would be best for him. He has been very good with the other dogs but prefers the female canines, in his foster home. Since he is on the cautious side, if there are children in the home they should be older than 12 years plus so as not to frighten him. We believe he has Beagle in him. He is food motivated but more lab characteristics than a hound. Once Taz knows you, he is very affectionate. He is not crated in his foster home as he has not been destructive. He sleeps on a doggy bed at night but we bet he would love to sleep on a bed with a family member if given the chance. He is really nice and quiet. He is very mature for his age. He eats well and is fed twice daily. Taz loves to play outside. We don't believe he was a house dog before as he was not housebroken when we got him. Now he loves to be cuddled up with his family watching TV and will go outside only if he has other dogs to keep him company or his family goes out at the same time. He will require a lot of leash work but he loves to go out so we believe it won't take long before he is walking nicely with his family. He has not been destructive in his foster home at all. He loves toys of all sorts. He rides quite well in the vehicle. The ideal home for Taz would be one where the family member or members are home a fair amount. Another female socialized dog that he can build his confidence from would work nicely. Older children 12 years plus would be fine. No cats for him as he has not been tested. Taz is neutered, up to date with vaccines, dewormed, and heartworm tested negative. A fully fenced yard and a Veterinarian History of Compliance is mandatory to apply for our Taz.\nVisit barksandmeows.ca for an online application. Available to Ontario Residents only!!!",

We would love nothing more than to find this senior girl a home to live her life out in, especially before the holidays. 2020 has not been kind to us. This includes Babii. She lost the only family she has ever known. We are very optimistic and hope that there is a special family willing to provide a nice stable, calm, warm and loving home for her. Sure, she has some medical issues that come with old age that a manager will be happy to explain to you. Once you meet hr you will agree that she is worth a little extra care. Babii gets a bit grumpy when you touch her backend so are requiring a home with much older children, 12 years and above. she will be fine sharing a home with a calm dog that respects her space and age, no rambunctious youngins! Babii would appreciate not having to go up any stairs, that comes with age. If you are looking to fill your home with the soulful eyes of a deserving dog then please ask to meet Babii today.",

But also very passive. Once cornered he will let you leash or \n           harness him easily. \n   \n   ?  The sounds of other people and children scare him. \n\n?  He enjoys walks in the woods (Away from strangers) and has an excellent sense          \n        of smell. \n\n    ?  Manny is great with most other dogs. He plays like a puppy. May be OK with  \n           cats?\n\n?   A shy dog can learn how to interact with humans by watching other dogs. A \n        home with another dog would really help Manny.\n\n    ?  He has improved since coming to the Shelter and will greet and take treats \n           from people he knows. It is rewarding to see the small milestones. \n\n    ?  Needs to be walked with a Martingale style or choke collar- Manny may be \n            able to slip out of regular collars and harnesses if he is very frightened.\n\n   \n    \n\n \n",

She adores people and would love nothing more than to have a family just love on her and give her all of the attention she deserves. She is about 5 years old and weighs about 70 lbs. She gets along with smaller more submissive dogs but can be afraid of larger dogs. We are guessing she formerly lived in a situation where she lived with dogs who did not treat her very nicely. She also needs a quieter home with no small children. She is the perfect companion for someone living alone or a retired couple in a quiet home. She is crate trained, gorgeous, sweet and looking for a family of her own!\n\nAvery is in a foster home in CO. A meet and greet can be arranged with an approved application.  She is spayed, up to date on all shots, microchipped and her adoption fee is $250.  Avery has been treated for heartworms, so she will just need to stay on preventatives. If you would like to add this cutie to your family, please complete an application here-\n\nhttps://www.tracyspawsrescue.org/adoption-application\n\n\nServices our dogs receive prior to adoption:\nChagas Testing\nHeartworm Testing (age appropriate)\nTick Illness Testing (age appropriate)\nAll age appropriate vaccines\nHeartworm and flea/tick preventatives \nSpay/neuter surgery \nMicrochip",

He is a good boy who would love to have a canine playmate. His new home needs to have a 6' privacy fence as he can easily get over anything shorter. He is crate trained but we do not know about house training.\n\nSchoep makes adoption fee of $350.00 includes his Vet exam, current vaccinations, fecal test, wormer, heart worm test, preventative, neuter and microchip.\n\nIf you live in the Austin area and are interested in adopting, please go to www.ForgottenFriendsTX.org and fill out an application. \n\nPlease be aware that we rarely have information on our dogs being good with cats as most of our foster homes don't have them. \n\nAdoption decisions are based on the best overall match and not done on a first-come-first-serve basis.",

            "description": "Mack is an adorable dog with a classic Bulldog face. He was about to be euthanized at a high kill shelter in GA when Eleventh Hour Rescue stepped in to save his life. Upon arrival it was very apparent that the kennel was stressful for Mack. He is friendly with everyone he meets but he tends to get very over stimulated. When he gets so excited or stimulated around his people he can sometimes grab his leash and begin pulling it. He has been undergoing training for this behavior and has made great progress! Of course, any owner would have to keep up on him with this training, and one with training and breed experience would be preferred.\n\nMack is good with other dogs outside of the home, but would do best in a house without other animals and with no children, as he can't always control himself when he gets stimulated. Due to Mack's stimulation issues, he would do best with an adopter with a fenced in yard!\n\nIf you are interested in Mack, please fill out an application at EHRDOGS.ORG and be sure to mention MACK BAILEY!",

He is Kind of an escape artist when left alone in our front Fenced Yard. This most likely comes from him being used to doing stuff on his own, looking for food/Shelter/ and mostly staying alive. So when being adopted he would probably need to get some steady basic Obedience Training. He is Pretty scared of new people and is still getting used to touch from People, But he's ready for his forever Home. He would probably be around 5-6 Years Old, and probably weighs somewhere around 35 Lbs. \n\nIf you would Like to adopt Pirata Please fill out an Adoption Application on our website through the link below.\n\n\nAdoption Application link:\nhttps://amigosdelosanimalespr.org/adoption-application/",

Although he loves all people and kids, he should not be homed with children because he has a tendency to get way too excited with them. Leo is a snuggle bug after he gets his energy out. He does get along with other dogs but again, can get too excited with them. We recommend an only dog house hold or another dog who can match his energy level but knows when enough is enough. Leo loves his toys and being around people.\n\nIf you are interested in Leo, visit EHRDOGS.ORG and fill out an application for LEO!!!!!!!",

Whether I'm running laps to burn off some energy, horsing around with my dog pals or just having a fun time with youit's all good to me, I love it all! But it's not all fun and games all the time - I do know some basic commands. And I'm a really sweet girl. Don't be surprised if I give you a kiss or twobut that's once we've gotten to know each other. I'm actually a bit shy when I first meet someone. It doesn't mean I don't want to be friends, I just like to take my time getting to know my humans - that's all.

He came to SFAS when his guardian could no longer care for him and is now ready to find another loving family to call his own. Here at the shelter, Jake is a little slow to warm up to new people but, once he gets to know you, he is a real sweetie. If you have another dog(s) at home please let the scheduler you will be bringing them along for a Meet n' Greet with Jake so that we can make sure everyone gets along well before going home Jake's adoption fee is $130. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. Interested in meeting with Jake or being added to his waitlist? Please call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals.
