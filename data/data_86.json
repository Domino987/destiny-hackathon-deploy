I have been at the Agoura Animal Care Center since September 20, 2020. \n\nChance came to us from our Lancaster Animal Care Center in September. We noticed immediately he was lame in his hind end. Taken to @malibucoastanimal it was discovered he had a broken femoral head. ? After having a successful surgery, with Dr Dean\u2019s brilliant surgical skills, Chance is recuperating and is ready to find his forever home!  \n\nChance loves a treat-stuffed Kong, lounging on the sofa in our \"real room\", belly rubs and stuffies.  He's got lots of energy, seems to be good with large dogs and would be okay with older children (middle school & up).  \n\nIf you think that Chance would be a good fit, drop us an e-mail to make an appointment to come meet him!\n\nSend an inquiry to agoura@animalcare.lacounty.gov and please include your contact phone number.",

My friends here at the Pet Center like to say that I have a very regal personality, and that I'm very smart and intuitive. I'm also such a good listener and will gladly sit and give you a high five, but only if you have my favorite jerky treats. Some of my other favorite things to do are play with my rope toys, roll in the grass and get belly rubs, and in return I will give you lots of slobbery kisses. I'm the kind of guy who really just wants to spend a ton of quality time with people and I recently heard that the hoomans have lots of free time right now, so if you think that I could be your newest play mate to help you pass the time then please e-mail adoption@lynchburghumane.org if you are interested to meet me today!",

She was adopted before me, and I was left alone waiting for a family... until Ace of Hearts rescued me :) \n\nI'm great on a leash, and I like to stay right by my human. I'm great in the car and appear to be housebroken. I'm looking for a safe home who can give me all of the love cuddles that I deserve!\n\nIf you're interested in Brodie, please fill out an application for him. He's currently in foster care, and we look forward to learning even more about his personality :) Here's the link - http://aceofhearts.wufoo.com/forms/ace-of-hearts-adoption-application/",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

After spending quite some time waiting for the right family, we offered our assistance.\u00a0\n\nSuki is healthy American Bulldog mix. She loves people and needs a calm home as an only pet or with someone with experience to work on food aggression. American Bulldogs are known for being loyal, inquisitive dogs with outgoing personalities and affectionate dispositions. Suki is a sweet girl and a survivor. She was deprived of the training she needed as a pup.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Suki \u00a0is ready for a person or entire family to love. In foster care, she is decompressing and learning she deserves to be comfortable.\u00a0 She has been around teenage boys and lots of women .\u00a0\n\n? 3 years\n\n? House trained\n\n? Spayed\u00a0\n\n? UTD on vaccines\u00a0\n\n? Heartworm negative\u00a0\n\n?? Microchipped\u00a0\n\n\nSuki has been wonderful with other dogs but will not tolerate anyone close to her food . So caution must be exercised with food and treats.\u00a0\n\nIf you are a match for Suki and interested in giving her a forever home, email\u00a0RescueHeartsAlabama@gmail.com\u00a0for more information. Fenced yard, inside home only and vet reference is required.",

She's not fond of small dogs and probably not good with cats.\n\nShe is learning to master the art of going up and down stairs.  Her energy level is mid-range.

He has his Canine Good Citizen title and has done well in non competitive agility classes.   Chester is crate trained and house trained.   He is currently in a wonderful foster home where he is enjoying lots of human attention. .  The following is a list of requirements for his new home:\n\nACTIVE!!!! ADULT only home.  Chester enjoys long walks!!\nFenced in Yard\nNo Cats or other small animals.\nAbility to provide adequate attention (no long periods without exercise/interaction.)\nPreferably no other dogs in the home - Chester tends to be a bit of a bully.\n\nIn addition to the above, Chester's new human(s) will have had experience with small dog resource guarding.  Chester will sometimes react negatively to being disturbed when sleeping or when he is chewing on a bone.  Good management skills will assure that he does not react inappropriately.  Once we receive an approved application, we are more than happy to further discuss Chester's behavior and management requirements.\n\nChester is currently taking obedience classes and is the \"star\" of the class.  He would excel in the obedience ring, in barn hunt trials, and agility competitions if his new human(s) continued with his training\n\nChester is current on all medical needs and is neutered.  For an online application, please contact us at reverence@ottcmail.com.  PLEASE NOTE: \n Phone calls are made only after an approved application is received.   A home visit will be required as part of the adoption process.   Potential adopters must reside within a 50 mile radius of Ithaca, NY or in Rochester.  Chester's adoption fee is $250.00.\n\n\n.\n\n\n",

Meet Ally! Ally is a super sweet 2 year pup. Her breed is just a guess but whatever this girl is mixed with, it's most likely sugar, spice and everything nice! She's a medium size girl at 42 pounds. Ally gets along great with other dogs. She's currently in a foster home with several pups and loves dogs of all sizes. Ally is the perfect mixture of play and cuddles. When she's not busy being her silly self romping in the yard, she's right on your lap! This girl LOVES affection and is very snuggly. Because Ally lives for love and affection, she requires a home where someone is around a portion of the day- no exceptions. She is a young dog and will need a home that can provide her the proper amount of exercise and will be dedicated to working with her on a leash. Ally is an athlete and can jump a short fence so any home with a fence will need to be 6 feet tall. She is not suited to apartment or condo living. Ally is not fostered in a home with children so a home with older respectful children would be best. With her sweet disposition, we feel this girl is the complete package!\n\nShe is house broken, spayed, up-to-date on vaccines and preventatives and eager to find a family to love!\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter.\n\n***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit). In addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.***\n\nIf you would like to meet Ally , please fill out our online application by clicking HERE and then email Kim at KLarimerLovepaws@gmail.com\n\n****If you are viewing this on\nPetFinder\nor other venues, please go to our website at www.lovepawspg.org to complete an application****",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Maribel (Mar-ee-bell), but I usually go by Mari (Mar-ee).  I an approximately 10 years young and  in good health.  My mom died unexpectedly, and though her family tried to find me a new home, I ultimately ended up at Legacy Boxer Rescue.  I have a 7 yr. old foster brother who is around 75 lbs. He's my friend, but it took about a month to warm up to playing with him because he is so big and barks loudly as he plays.  I don't bark often, but I certainly know how to speak my mind! And I do love eating!\n\nI have a saucy personality and a face that sometimes looks like I'm mad or serious. Really I'm quite a happy girl. I love long walks, and still have energy to chase a ball or toy when I get back home.  And in true boxer fashion, I love to play keep away with the item once I have it.\n\nAlthough I do not jump up on people, I am quite intense about chasing the ball/toy and could accidentally knock over a toddler. My foster family doesn't know how I would act around young children as they don't have any, but based on my friendliness to people in general, they think I'd do fine with supervised pet educated children. I am house trained and will tolerate a crate.  I have very good manners on a leash and love to prance up to new people since I'm friendly.  My intake notes say I'm good with cats, but I think what they meant is that I am highly interested in fast furry things and very good at chasing them!  I haven't caught one yet, but my foster mom thinks I might not be very gentle if I caught one. I do know sit, stay, down, wait commands.  I also know come, but sometimes i like to act like I didn't hear you.  But I can sure hear a snack bag opening from the back yard!\n\nMy favorite thing is having lots of time with my family.  I like to be as close to them as possible.  And what girl doesn't like a cozy blanket to snore in!  If you think you might like a sassy sweet older gal to spend time with, please let me know so we can meet!\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please fill out our adoption application to begin the process at http://savetheboxers.com/adoptionapp.php.\n\nIf you aren't able to adopt at this time, please consider making a much needed, tax-deductible donation to Legacy Boxer Rescue at http://savetheboxers.com/donate.php.",

Could you imagine being tethered your whole life and then FINALLY, coming inside to a world of strange sights, sounds, and people!\n\nAt 8 years old, Kane does have some eye issues where he is on daily meds. This may be one of the reasons he does not like strangers and men.\n\nHe also does not do well around other animals, which makes sense. If you were outside and limited on how far you could move or run, you would be on the defense of anything entering your space too.\n\nHe met the WSBT-TV cameraman, Mark for the pet segment airing Sunday. At first he barked at him, but as we did the segment, he started walking towards the camera and rubbing past Mark. He is definitely a boy who needs a slow, calm approach.\n\nKane is spoiled by staff at the shelter. He gets his breakfast burrito here and there, cuddles out of his kennel, and leisure walks around the shelter.\n\nThis big boy has been at the shelter since April, and became adoptable in October. He is currently the longest term adoptable dog at the shelter. His friend Cinnamon found a place to call home for the holidays. Now it is his turn!\n\nKane appears to be potty trained, BUT we always encourage new owners to pretend the new pup is not until everyone is used to the new routine.",

            "description": "Meet Hummer\nHummer is an amazing dog. He was surrendered on October 10, 2020 when his owners couldn\u2019t be found and his heroes who fostered him were unable to keep him. \nHummer is a gorgeous six year old German Shepherd/ Retriever mix. He has a beautiful chocolate and white coat. He weighs 60 pounds. Hummer is house-broken, loves car rides and going for hikes and long walks with his person. Hummer likes being with other dogs and might benefit by having a doggie companion to keep him company. Hummer will do best in a quiet, calm house with older children. He chases cats and will need to be in a home without them.\nGaining trust will be important for his new person. Hummer is showing signs of past abuse. He appears afraid of sudden movements to grab hold of him and he\u2019s very head shy. He may have been hit about the head and leashes jerked on and off of him. He\u2019ll duck to protect himself. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see these behaviors. But with a kind and gentle family who understands his fears, we think they\u2019ll be able to help him forget his past and help him grow in confidence and trust. The shelter environment is also hard on Hummer. Every day he becomes a bit more anxious. He doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to him or how he found himself \u2018locked-up.\u2019 We\u2019ve moved his kennel so he can see the outside and we try and give him outside time as much as possible to ease his anxiety. These are new behaviors for him. Per his foster family, he\u2019s a much different dog when he\u2019s away from the shelter and with people he knows and trusts. He\u2019s much more relaxed, affectionate and happy-go-lucky. We hope his forever family comes for him soon so he can leave the shelter behind and begin to live and love again. \nIf you\u2019re looking for your best buddy and are able to open your heart and home to a dog needing some TLC, Hummer might be the one for you. He is a special boy with an incredible personality, he just needs that special person to give him a chance at a happy life. \nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.  If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy., Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.\n",

            "description": "Ellie\nLabrador Retriever Mix\nGender: Female\nDOB: 08/01/2018\nAdoption Fee: $175\nPLEASE READ BIOGRAPHY BEFORE APPLYING FOR ADOPTION.\nHi there! I'm Ellie! I'm a sweet, playful, energetic, and funny girl! I love to go for a run, swim, or a long hike. I love toys, balls, and treats! I am a very special girl. I will REQUIRE a home with patience and someone willing to continue my training. \nEllie has been trained on an e-collar and knows some commands. She was trained and housed for 3 weeks with a specialty trainer that heard of her story. Ellie was adopted from a shelter last year and the owners were advised by a \"\"trainer\"\" (not affiliated) to keep her crated for 20 hours a day, and put her on a medication called Trazadone for anxiety. She was on a very high dose of that medication. She has since been tapered down to a low dose, and there is a possibility that she can be tapered down and taken off the medication under the supervision of a veterinarian. Ellie has to be on a strict schedule and exercise regimen to release her energy. Ellie gets along with other dogs. That being said, some dogs do not like her excitement and won't tolerate her. She will need to be slowly introduced to other dogs if so desired. She has been to dog parks with a volunteer and has played well with a few select dogs that tolerated her excitement. She would do well to have a regular playmate as that will stimulate her brain in a good way and expel her energy as well. If you are interested in adopting or fostering Ellie, please submit an adoption application at www.humanemorgan.org/adopt/Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n\nIn order to adopt one of our animals an application must be submitted and approved. You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening. In these cases we may require a higher fee to help recoup the costs of their care while at our rescue.",

            "description": "Isn't Flax handsome? This dog is truly a transformation. He came to Labs and More severely underweight, missing fur and in desperate need of medical care. He has spent the last few weeks in a foster home and look at him now! He's healthy, happy and ready for a forever home! Flax is about 5 years old and we think he's a Shepherd mix with possibly Akita. True to his breed mix, he is very smart, playful and has a lot of energy. He will need an active family that can work out his mind and body every day. He has learned his basic commands but still needs to refine his manners and still likes to pull on leash. He's just so excited for his next adventure! Sometimes he doesn't realize his own size and gets a little rambunctious at playtime so he may be a little much for small children. He is friendly with new people and gets along with other dogs but thinks all kitties should be chased so needs a home with no cats. Flax is affectionate and loves to be pet, and he would prefer a home where his humans are home more often than not. He would be a great adventure buddy as he loves car rides, exploring trails and playing in the water. If you are interested in meeting Flax, please submit an adoption application on our website. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "Find your new exercise bestie in Pita! She is around 3 years old and we think she is a Belgian Malinois and Shepherd mix. This girl is always ready to hop in the car for her next adventure at your side! True to her breed mix, she is a very high energy dog and will need an active family ready to commit to training and working out Pita's mind and body every day. She needs a lot more than a couple walks around the neighborhood every day. She runs alongside her foster mom while she bikes for exercise and would love a family that enjoys daily hiking or looking for a daily running partner. Once she gets her exercise out, she is sweet and easygoing. Pita is very smart and has learned to heel on leash and several basic commands, including Sit, Down, Leave It, Wait, and Go to Your Bed. She tolerates the cats in her foster home but would love to chase them if given the chance. If she went to a home with kitties, they will already need to be dog savvy and she will need a strong pack leader that will make her mind her manners. She is still working on how to settle down and properly interact with other dogs. For now, she would do best as an only dog in her home and isn't a dog for dog parks, dog beaches or dog daycare. Pita would also do best with a family that is home more often than not. She is still learning it's ok to be alone when her foster family leaves and what she should and should not chew on. Pita will need a confident, dedicated family ready to set firm boundaries and continue her training. In return, you will get a loving and loyal companion for life. If you are interested in meeting Pita, please submit an adoption application on our website.

            "description": "Meet Lager! He is around 3 years old and we think he is a yellow Lab mix. Lager loves his people so much he'd like to be your one and only dog. He isn't sure about other dogs so probably would not enjoy trips to the dog park or beach. He thinks all kitties should be chased so will need a forever home without cats. He loves long walks around the neighborhood and is working on his leash manners. At home, he is just as happy to chill out and relax. He is housetrained with access to a yard. Lager enjoys attention from kids. He is eager to please, loves his food and has learned to sit and lay down. He will enjoy working with you to learn more! Lager knows bedtime means getting comfy in his crate. If you are interested in meeting Lager, please submit an adoption application on our website. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application.

If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced.

This cheerful boy knows how to entertain himself with toys if you're busy, and he's a playful pup when you throw him a toy. He loves tossing around rope toys and racing after tennis balls, but less is more for a such a sweet boy like Allen. There is nothing better than the time he spends snuggled up against his favorite people. Allen is a smart pup who's responding very well to his training, and working on his leash skills and socializing with other dogs. Plus, he has the puppy dog eyes down to a tee!

            "description": "Bonded pair must go together!\n\nPugsy (bonded with Lilly)\n-approx. age 7\n-potty trained and pee pad trained and uses the doggie door to access the fenced patio\n\n-Likes: Pugsy likes toys and balls but mostly likes to play with Lilly while Lilly plays with the toys. She loves to lay in the sun, even when it's hot. Very affectionate.\n-Dislikes: Barks at the delivery man, recycle truck, sounds in general, and is more jumpy than Lilly. She's the timid one and will generally stay behind me if I'm walking around the house, but does welcome cuddles and pets, lap time, etc.\n\n-okay in crate: Yes, will get in crate on demand and sometimes go in on her free will, especially if Lilly is already in the crate. Does not sleep in the crate overnight, so not sure if she would whine.\n-okay on leash: Like Lilly, Pugsy loves to walk on the leash but is so excited that she pulls.\n-okay when meeting other dogs: No, we keep our distance, as they are not socialized to other dogs.\n\nPugsy is not as bright as Lilly, but I was able to train her to get into the crate and use the doggie door, both took a while. We haven't gotten much farther than that.\n\nThey were both easily transitioned to healthier food and treats. Earlier on, Lilly would eat all of Pugsy's food, if she was allowed too. She doesn't do that now, but I do generally watch them both eat before I take them out.\n\nCome see this pup on Saturdays during adoption event hours. Please email Linda at lbredfire@sbcglobal.net or call WT&F's Dog Team voicemail 707-812-9030 to get a jump on the process, ask questions, and/or to confirm they will be there. Dog adoptions are held outside Napa Petco every Saturday - 12:30pm to 4:00pm.\nThis dog comes spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, dewormed, heartworm tested negative, and more with an adoption fee/donation to Whiskers, Tails and Ferals in Napa, CA.

            "description": "Please contact Linda for more information about this pet.\nLilly (bonded with Pugsy): Must be adopted together!\n-approx. age: 4yrs\n-potty trained and pee pad trained, but does drink a lot of water so needs to go out more regularly. Uses the doggie door to access the fenced patio. She also does have excited leaky pee accidents, so I give her loves after she has gone out in the morning or I have just returned home, etc.\n\n-Likes: Loves squeaky tennis balls and squeaky plush toys. Likes to play fetch but mostly teases with the return, rather than dropping the ball/stick for you to throw again. I'm working with her to learn 'drop it'. Very affectionate and loves to be on your lap.\n-Dislikes: Barks at the delivery man, recycle truck, etc, but not as much as Pugsy. Is able to get to know usual visitors over time, and will greet them lovingly. My sister visited once a week for 3 weeks and they are now friends. Dislikes the mobile groomer but is easily groomed, including nails trimmed and dryer.\n\n-okay in crate: Yes, goes to the crate on her own, and naps there, etc. I do not crate them overnight, so not sure if they would whine if in the crate for that long.\n-okay on leash: Loves walks but pulls on leash and is overly excited.\n-okay when meeting other dogs: Not socialized to other dogs, very strongly bonded to Pugsy.\n\nLilly is very smart and treat motivated. She will get in the crate on demand, sit, go to bed, go potty, go poop (I trained with bits of hotdog) and I'm sure eager to learn many other things.\n\nCome see this pup on Saturdays during adoption event hours. Please email Linda at lbredfire@sbcglobal.net or call WT&F's Dog Team voicemail 707-812-9030 to get a jump on the process, ask questions, and/or to confirm they will be there.

She's been really scared and took a couple days to warm up, but we are officially besties!\nWe are getting to know Sally and should have more details soon. She appears to do well with most dogs, but will warn them if her space is being invaded. Sally can be unsure at times so she is not for a household with kiddos. No exceptions.\nContact us if you're interested in adopting this gal.",

I was rescued by my foster on the streets of Tijuana (almost hit trying to cross the street when my rescuer saved me!).I am a very sweet, calm and quiet boy. In the beginning when you meet me I will be quite timid and scared but will warm up to you pretty fast.  I love people, riding in the car, get along great with other dogs and play pretty rough with my other dog buddies at the house.  My rescuers are teaching me how to walk on a leash so that I can take walks with you and hang out (really looking forward to that!). I am looking for a home with a yard, a buddy I can play with and a family that will love me and take care of me so I never end up on the street and homeless again.  If you fit that bill then I\u2019m looking forward to meeting you!",

We are glad they didn't bail her out of doggie prison because no dog deserves that life.\nYou have to see this short little lady in person to know just how cute she is!

They ended up at a shelter after their owner went into hospice.\nThe shelter took care of their dental, spays, vaccines, and microchips. We just tested them and they are heartworm negative.\nThese two are ready to be adopted!!\nTheir foster momma is the best! She dotes on them and has worked with them to be home ready. They have moved away from pee pads to pottying outside. Baby loves everything and everyone. Angel has come out of her shell and has shown to be a sweet little lady. They both rate very high on the cuddle scale!!",

            "description": "7 month old Puppy Bear is a very smart and active puppy. He will thrive in a home that understands that and gives him a job to do. He is mostly potty trained, crate trained and is busy practicing his good puppy skills. He knows sit, down, wait, and is learning to walk nicely on a leash. His favorite game is ball, and he will play for hours!!\n\nLooking for a hiking buddy? He is ready to sign up. Do you need a sous chef? He loves assisting in the kitchen. He is living with another resident dog and cat. He is tolerant of his kitty roommate, but sometimes needs a reminder that his is much bigger, and needs to play nice.\n\nSmall children may not work for Puppy Bear due to his exuberance. Older middle school or high school children are fine.\n\nPlease remember, adopting a puppy is not everyone's cup of tea. As cute as they are - puppies demand a large investment of time, patience, and training. They are inquisitive, have endless energy and get into just about everything. They dig, chew, and seemingly never stop! Think long and hard about your lifestyle.\n\nIf you are not willing to invest the time and training to ensure your puppy matures into the wonderful dog - then please consider an older dog.\n\nPlease go to our website and complete an adoption application at:\n\n/https://www.gsroc.org/application/\n\nAn adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.",

            "description": "Alexander is 1 year old and 50 lbs. He is deaf, but that doesn't stop him from running around the yard and playing with the other dogs. He is a curious, and energetic boy who chases his shadow and tail when not chasing the other dogs. You have to get his attention with hand movements....don't surprise him, it scares him.\nCame from home with youngsters - he adores his people and, as you can see, his bubble baths.\nHe is back with us to learn to not jump up on people. Not pleasant, especially for petite or senior folks. So Alex is taking some training. However, he is a sweet boy that would love a home.\nThough he cannot hear, communication with the animals is telepathic. He knows what you're saying.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

            "description": "Gemini is a 1 year old Boxer & American Bully mix per a Embark DNA test. She came to us in June 2020. Her owner had recently acquired her from a relative. She had fallen off the bed and broken her back leg. We had her leg plated. Then she got happy tail. This is where they are super happy and wag a lot. The end of the tail hits stuff and blood goes everywhere. She had her tail amputated as a result.\u00a0Gemini recently completed a 2 week board and train. learn more obedience. The trainers are completely positive. She knows the following commands: paw, sit, down, stay, front position, heel, leave it, back, and watch me.\u00a0\n\nGemini is a large active dog and would do best in a home without small children due to her size. She is not aggressive but often when excited she forgets her size. She is very intelligent and a quick learner. Gemini needs an active home that will also keep her mentally stimulated. Gemini is good with other dogs and likes to play a lot. She does play rough with other\u00a0dogs. She shouldn\u2019t be in a home with small furry dogs or cats due to prey drive.\n\nShe's had multiple great exams. She had an xray to clear her leg. She's had multiple fecals and urinalysis. She is up to date on vaccinations,flea, and heartworm prevention. She is heartworm negative, spayed, and microchipped. She's on science diet prescription cd for high ph levels in her urine. She's on joint supplements. She's on nexgard as she showed signs of potential demodex mange. This is not contagious. The nexguard flea prevention does not allow any mange growth.\nShe's located in New Orleans LA but she can be adopted anywhere. We'd be willing to help with transport costs.\n\nHere are two videos playing with a large unneutered dog:\nhttps://youtu.be/zyT9Z5cnR34\nhttps://youtu.be/jIt-kiIqcFM\n\nHere is a few commands:\nhttps://youtu.be/dR9HNiAXTyo",

She's ok with some other animals but it varies; she is fine around male dogs. She has shown dominance around many other females and is not good with small dogs unless they are absolutely not afraid of her and willing to stand their ground.\n\nFun Fact: She can jump a 5-6 ' wall!\n\nShe's happiest when she is just running and playing!\n\nThe fee is $350. She is up to date on all preventative medical and appropriately groomed. Give us a call with any questions or to come meet her; she is currently fostered in Tucson. Homes will be screened and must qualify for basic stability and safety, as with all groups on Petfinder.com! (602) 626-5700 E-mail is best: shellie@pylesofsmiles.com",

She has some spunk in her personality and is just the sweetest, silliest girl around! She LOVES to smile, give kisses and sit on your lap. Clearly, she is head over heels for her humans!! She is not a dog that needs a lot of exercise due to age and arthritis, but sure does LOVE to play. She will get a little cranky towards other dogs at times. She does not like it when dogs get near her food while she is eating. Eating time is her peace time! #respect\n\nRemy is also a very smart girl who knows basic commands and LISTENS. She will politely bark to let you know she has to use the bathroom and listens to \"no\" very well. \n\nRemy would do best:\n-Small family (1-3 people)\n-Preferably only pet in the home\n-Someone with patience and lots of love!\n\nA note from foster: \"Remy is a puppy at heart. She smiles when she\u2019s happy and doesn\u2019t let her arthritis slow her down. She is respectful and listens very well. Anyone would be lucky to have such a sweet girl.\"\n\nIf you would like to meet REMY, fill out our adoption application: https://form.jotform.com/93263081961156\n\nPlease contact us via email info@mercyfullprojects.org or 813 836 0711 (TEXT ONLY) directly with any questions you might have!",

            "description": "Nessie was originally purchased by an older person who was not able to care for her and surrendered her to a shelter.  She was then rehomed to a home with a male dog, who she did not get along with.  She is selective with other dogs, and would do best as a solo dog.  She is a dominant female, which is common in this breed.  She is very intelligent and loving, just does not want to share her people with other dogs. Nessie does not do well with cats. According to her last owner Nessie does know how to sit, give you a paw, sometimes lay down, and sit, and give you both paws. She is fine with children, however we do recommend a home for her with older teenage children.  \n\nWe suggest obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 15 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nNessie will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Max was originally owned by an elderly farmer, who was afraid he would fall over him and gave him to someone to rehome him, but unfortunately, their efforts were not successful and he was surrendered to IGPR.  Max is a very gentle giant, who is very calm and  friendly.  He gets along well with other dogs, and is unproven with cats.  Based on his temperament, he would be fine with children, he likes everyone, but is a little timid at first. Max is positive for heartworm and is undergoing treatment.  We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nMax will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $250",

It took a couple of weeks to warm up to foster mom, but now she is very bonded to foster mom. Mona is not crazy about the other dogs in the house and is quite bossy about the dinner bowl and sharing mom's lap. She's enjoying having a warm bed and a better diet now, but only has 3 teeth so she prefers canned food and small kiblet dry food. We believe she is at least 6 years old. Mona's family decided they did want to care for her any longer, were moving and did not wish to take her. Mona would like to find a special human that is going to love her and give her a secure home and have lots of patience with her (this is very important). Mona's ideal home should be:\n-no young children\n-no other dogs or maybe one other dog that can put her in her place without harming her\n-no cats\n-no men unless they are patient and willing to give her time (She will warm up eventually. She now likes foster mom's boyfriend mostly.)\n-a single woman who is possibly home most of the time to spend with her\nMona is spayed, current on her vaccines, heartworm negative, microchipped, and on flea and heartworm prevention. Her adoption fee is $175.\n**Application to begin adoption!** (Applicants are contacted in the order we receive responses.)\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1l55Ts1AJ_ijHnV8BwF-CzzLDJr7zynGOKiNC6wMTFgQ/edit",

She will follow you everywhere and especially loves to snuggle while she snores in your ear. Avery loves to play with toys and has an obsession with soft blankets. She also loves to swim and play in the water. She is good with other dogs as long as they are nice to her. I'm not sure about cats. Avery would love an active family that will take her on daily walks. She may not be good with small children only because she might knock them down with her puppy energy. Avery recently had surgery to correct urinary incontinence. She is all healed up and now ready for adoption! Will you be her Valentine? Please apply at\n\nwww.hhfrescue.org.\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

            "description": "~Tucker came to Almost Home Dog Rescue from Alabama. He was meant to be a hunting dog but that wasn't the right fit for him. He did see neglect & was very skinny. He is now gaining weight & will probably be about 50lbs. and is 2 years old.\n\nHe is good with other dogs & people. He can become startled if someone reaches for him when he is sleepy so he would do best in a family without young children. He prefers more quiet home atmosphere. Most of the time he goes with the flow once his routine is established with his people. He is housebroken. He loves to walk on the leash. He does enjoy a fence in yard to wander on his own & run if possible. He loves to settle in with his people at the end of the day & sleeps through the night on a doggie bed or on the couch. He is looking for a best friend so a single person household or a couple looking for a companion dog would suit him as well.\n\nTucker is housebroken, crate trained (if necessary, but doesn't love it) and rides well in the car. He hasn't been around cats so that's an unknown.\n\nPlease email us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com to find out if Tucker is the right one for you! (Local adoptions preferred - Philadelphia and tri-state area [South Jersey and northern Delaware] only.)\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US!\nWe are NOT a shelter: All of our dogs live in private homes with foster families. Come and meet the Almost Home dogs and their fosters at our Meet & Greet events, where you can learn more about our wonderful dogs from the people who live with them, find out which dogs are on their way and when they'll arrive, and fill out an application to adopt or foster.\n\nWe cannot adopt to homes where electric-shock fencing systems or training collars are used. For more information on the dangers of electric-shock collars, please visit banshockcollars.ca/studies.php and http://www.hollysden.com/say_no_to_shock.htm (scroll down and click on the \"Invisible Fencing Systems\" link).\n\nWe do not have an online adoption application; to request an application, e-mail us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com. To speed e-mail processing time, be sure to note the name of the dog you are inquiring about in the Subject line. For Meet & Greet times and locations, visit our home page, where you also will find information on our adoption process and fees.\n\nFOSTER FAMILIES ARE LIFESAVERS!! Can you open your heart and home for a few weeks to homeless shelter dog? Remember, by fostering a dog, you save TWO lives - that of your foster dog, and that of the dog who takes his place in the shelter! Come to a Meet & Greet and find out if fostering is for you - there's no reward quite like the feeling that you've saved a life ... or two!",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KELTON, PLEASE GO TO WWW.MOMSVA.ORG AND COMPLETE AN APPLICATION. \n\nKelton is a 1 \u00bd year old lab mix.  He weighs about 40 lbs and is medium size.  Kelton is all about playing with his friends, chewing on bones, destroying toys to get the squeaker.  He loves to go for walks and car rides.  In the yard Kelton loves running around with his friend, Daisy to see who is the fastest. He loves stalking her and surprising her with a big pounce.   He loves cuddling with his foster mom either in bed or on the sofa.  He is crate trained and house trained.  Kelton loves to talk to you when he wants something or it is bed time.  Even in his crate, he will talk to you with little woofs to let you know that he has to go to the bathroom.  His little woofs are just the cutest. \n\n \n\nKelton is working on keeping down from the counters.  But he is a fast learner and we know that he will get it soon.  He does love to learn new tricks and loves to be rewarded for doing them right.  He loves ice, carrots, and any dog treats.  His favorite is frozen peanut butter in his Kong with a frozen carrot in it to lick and chew on when he has to go into his crate.\n\n \n\nKelton would do best in a house with a fenced in yard.  He would also do best with another dog to play with since that is his favorite thing to do.  Kelton is an awesome dog and has this look and head tilt that tells you he is listening to you.\n\n \n\nIf you can\u2019t resist a handsome face, go to www.momsva.org and complete an application to see if you could be a match. \n",

He\u2019s fixed and up to date on vaccinations. Look at his beautiful blue and white coat and awesome markings! What a pretty boy!\n\nLoki spent time in a boarding facility until a foster home could be found. He is a complicated and sweet guy who is too smart for his own good. He CANNOT be with other male dogs or kittens. He lives with two female Pit mixes and is good with them. I wouldn\u2019t recommend children because of his temperament, nor a first time dog owner. He needs a calm and stable home with experienced dog person/people who understand the breed. \n\nThe vet called Loki \u201con guard\u201d. He\u2019s anxious and I would wager there\u2019s some sort of abuse history. You have to be very careful to not startle him or try to touch him without him seeing your hands first. He takes 40mg of generic Prozac daily to help him stay calmer and more comfortable. It is inexpensive through Walmart or other pharmacies.  \n\nLoki loves car rides and can walk on a leash. He doesn\u2019t like to be shut in his crate but will nap in there when we leave the door open. He is house trained and very good about letting you know when he needs to go outside. \n\nLoki loves to run and go for walk. He needs a secure, fenced in yard because he likes to roam.  He is terrified of thunderstorms and usually waits them out in our windowless laundry room. \n\nAdoption Fee $150\n\nFoster is Shelly/Kelly\n\n",

She starts off very timid and shy but once you earn her trust, she changes into an excited snuggly pup! She came to MTM as a stray, so she is working on learning that people are ok, slowly but surely.\nLikes: Playing with the other dogs in the home, snuggling with humans and her dog friends\nDislikes: Loud noises\nPersonality: Starlight is shy and timid at first but once she is comfortable, she loves hitting the backyard for some zoomies. She is your typical puppy so she will help herself to anything she thinks she can chew and LOVES toys.\nTemperament: Timid, we are just now starting to earn her trust after about a month.\nEnergy Level: Spurts of high energy/zoomies throughout the day. Also ok with hanging out and observing the activities of the home\nGood with: Dogs and Kids over 6 years old\nNot good with: NOT cat tested, timid around men but warms up eventually\nHouse Trained: 90% house trained, will have an occasional accident every now and again\nCrate Trained: Yes, this is her safe place, will require a crate in her new home\nChallenges: Due to her lack of trust in people we are slowly working on basic commands but must work at her pace\nMedical: Still slightly underweight.\nPerfect Home: Star's perfect home would have another dog that could match her energy and want to play regularly. She loves running and is fast so a fenced in yard is required for her safety. She is also nimble so a 6ft fence would be preferred. She is easily spooked and will retreat to her crate or another safe space until she feels comfortable. Starlight currently loves her 12 and 15 year old foster kids, but she must initiate the want for affection on her terms.\nFostered in Camp Hill, PA.\nApplication Fees, Adoption Donations and Rescue Policy: Please know that 100% of our funds are used for rescuing the dogs.\nOur rescue policy requires the following:\n\nAdopters must have their primary residence in one of the following states: Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and parts of North Carolina and and parts of New York.\nWe will not adopt a giant breed dog to homes where the dog will have access to highly varnished hardwood steps inside the home. Any inside steps to which the dog(s) have access, must have carpeting, securely fixed stair treads, or a non-skid surface. We encourage you to remediate potential safety issues while your application is under review, prior to the home visit.\nMethods or devices using pain or force on the dog to control the dog, or to deter undesirable behavior is prohibited.\nApplications for giant breed dogs must be submitted by the property owner.\nHomes with children under 6 years of age will not be approved for adoption.\nHomes with children should have a fenced yard.\nPets currently in the applicant's home must have a history of appropriate veterinary care. Veterinary records will be checked.\nAll references must be checked before any visitation of the dog is permitted at the foster home.\nAll family members must be present during the home visit to the applicant's home.\nAny dog(s) in the applicant's home must have an introductory meeting with the rescue dog being considered, before any adoption can be completed.\nHomes with intact dogs will not be approved for adoption.

To see dogs please download an application from our website, www.adifferentbreed.org and email to foster parents address above. We will arrange a meet and greet.

            "description": "IMPORTANT!!!   All adoptions are by appointment only going forward and are spaced 30 minutes apart. PLEASE call the shelter directly during business hours for more information (see number below).  You need to make sure that the animal in which you have an interest is still available and to set up an appointment to meet the specific animal.  Once you arrive at the shelter for your scheduled appointment, please follow the directions that you were given over the telephone. If you are running late for your appointment or will be unable to make your scheduled appointment time, notify staff immediately. This will enable them to schedule that time for another prospective adoptive family. If necessary, they will be able to reschedule your appointment to a more convenient time.  \n\nREGGIE arrived in October in poor condition with broken canine teeth and his ribs showing.  Staff has been lovingly working to put weight on this 8-year-old neutered American Bully mix dog.  As a result his coat has gotten pretty and glossy. He is still thin, but is looking better in that respect, too. You can meet him by calling to schedule an adoption appointment.  In the meantime, staff is giving him great care which he appreciates.  Especially at feeding time!  Because he is already neutered, he can go home the same day he is adopted. If you are willing to provide him with good food, love and a real home, consider adopting him. The shelter is full and open kennels are always needed for more incoming animals.\n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. Please be sure to take the exact amount with you.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",

He does have separation anxiety and can be destructive if left alone and loose, but it is manageable. We are looking for a home where someone is with him most of the day and can securely kennel him when away. He does bark when nervous, so apartment/condo living with shared walls would not be the right fit.\n\nBuddy is very high energy so he is looking for an active home where he can get the exercise & activity he needs. He loves toys and would do best with a fenced in yard. Buddy can be on the submissive side when playing with other dogs and does not always read the social signs, but he really enjoy playing with his furry foster siblings. He has been reactive to any cats he sees, though so that would not be a good fit.\n\nIf you are interested in Buddy Gio, please fill out an application at www.ehrdogs.org & be sure to mention her name, BUDDY GIO!",

He takes treats gently and knows the word \u201csit.\u201c Out of caution, however, HOBBS will be adopted only to someone with no other animals. Obviously, he still needs to be neutered and can go to a new home only after that procedure is done.

            "description": "This friendly girl is Daisy - she's a 5-year-old Boxer mix weighing about 45 pounds. She is very sweet & loving, just wants to please her people & is calm and gentle. She definitely has a Boxer personality and likes to give hugs!\n\nThis girl has been through so much. Dumped by owners, she was surrendered to a kill shelter and left to die. She was out of time when one of our rescue partners pulled her but wasn't able to find a rescue for her right away. Our rescue partner has had her for several months and she has done great with most dogs big and small. However, she can be selective at times due to being attacked by another dog.\n\nDaisy's major issue is regular inappropriate urination. Our rescue partner has done an abdominal Ultrasound to rule out a mass (which looked normal), bloodwork to rule out Cushings or Addisons (again normal). At this point the vet believes it is either Diabetes Insipidus or psychosomatic. She is currently on meds for diabetics insipidus (there is no test - either the meds work and that the diagnosis, or they don't).\n\nDaisy is the sweetest dog and deserves to be able to run and play outside and nap on the couch. Unfortunately she isn't able to do that in the foster home with the other dog who attacked her. Instead, she has to be kept separated for her own safety. Daisy has so much love to give, she deserves a home of her own where she will feel safe & be loved.\n\nDaisy is currently located in Eastern North Carolina. A meet and greet can be arranged for a serious adopter who understands what is involved and would be willing to work with her to overcome her medical issues. If you'd like to meet her, please fill out an application at www.ehrdogs.org & be sure to mention her name, DAISY GIO!",

            "description": "Sasha is a 7 year old Lab/Heeler mix who joined the C.A.R.E. Family after being rescued from death row at Animal Control. She was blind and suffering from a terrible skin infection. We immediately took her to see our veterinarian where she was diagnosed with allergies. Sasha was prescribed a once a day medication that she will need to continue to take at her new home. She definitely feels so much better now! Some of her hair loss may be permanent but we make sure to tell her how beautiful she is each and every day. Sasha's results from her bloodwork to check for any other underlying illnesses all came back great as well. :) \n\nSasha is excited to meet her forever family! She is blind but she doesn't let that slow her down one bit.. She just relies a little more on her other senses to guide her and help her memorize new surroundings. This smart girl can sniff out a treat jar in no time! Sasha gets along well with other dogs and she would love to find a home with a nice fenced yard where she can enjoy some time outside with her new family. Sasha knows basic commands and a few fun tricks that she can not wait to show off for her new fanily!\n\nYou can meet Sasha in person at our adoption center located at 1328 West Sunshine St. Springfield MO. We are open Thursday, Friday, and Sat from 10am to 4pm. You can also submit a online dog adoption application at www.carerscue.org to be pre-approved to adopt Sasha. All C.A.R.E rescue dogs are fully vaccinated, heart-worm tested, spayed/neutered, and microchipped!\n\nOur adoption fee is a minimum $100 tax deductible donation. All donations are used for rescue and medical care of animals in need. If you don't have room to take home a pet but want to support our efforts to save animals in need, please consider donating. We are not city or state funded and rely solely on private donations that allow us to continue saving lives.\n\nTo learn more about us or to give a lifesaving donation please visit http://www.carerescue.org",

The family did their best to take care of them but during this difficult time it became overwhelming.  ARL stepped up and drove to Sierra Blanca with the family to rescue their dogs.  The dogs are now being taken care of and up for adoption.  Oreo started out still stand-offish toward us but is definitely doing much better.  ARL is working with her, she loved her owners.  She is about 3 years old.   They all are doing well, some better than others, they just need a little more time.  You can view some videos on ARL's Facebook for more of their story and rescue.  More pictures to come.  My adoption fee is $125-150 which includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations,  heartworm disease test,  microchip/registration fee and collar .  ADOPT ME TODAY and find a friend for life!   And remember that adopting a pet is a life long commitment.",

I like to play with other dogs but I can sometimes be a little bit selective when it comes to who I choose to interact with. I would benefit from an experienced dog owner who can help me get out of my shell a little bit. I can be a little shy at times, but I've got a truly sweet soul and I'm just looking for people who can help me build my confidence. I would benefit from an experienced dog owner who can guide me through life. I think I could be happy in a busy or a quiet lifestyle but either would take some getting used to for me. I could benefit from some continued training, as I am not quite potty-trained yet, but I do love to go for long leashed walks and have picked up that skill very quickly so I think that I can get the hang of anything if you give me a little bit of time. I love to go outside so much that when it's time to come in, don't be surprise if I start to alligator roll on my back in protest!",

I am a very sweet girl but you might notice that I walk a little bit slower than most. I have some eye problems and struggle to see but that doesn't keep me from wanting to greet everyone that I meet! I am selective when it comes to which dogs I will engage with and would probably be the best fit for an experienced dog owner who can help guide me through life. I would be very happy living a quiet lifestyle and I don't need much space so I would be perfect for someone living in an apartment. If you're looking for a gentle soul and don't mind me bumping into a few things, I could be the perfect pick for you!",

Like to go on hikes and explore nature? Chloe does too! Any outdoor activity is Chloe\u2019s favorite and if you want to bring a ball with you for her to fetch, she\u2019s pretty much in heaven!\n\nPeople puppy! Chloe loves her humans! She\u2019s never met a person she doesn\u2019t like, and this social butterfly has met quite a few people. Since she prefers to be with her people, sometimes she forgets her manners when left by herself. But, she\u2019s happy in her crate when you must leave her and knows it\u2019s a safe space that she can relax in.\n \nSweet as can be! When she\u2019s outside Chloe is all about the activities, but when she comes inside, she\u2019s all about showing you how much she loves you! She\u2019s very affectionate and likes to be as close to you as you\u2019ll let her!\n\nLooking for the dog that can keep up on every adventure? Chloe\u2019s your girl!\n",

Hes super-affectionate, playful, happy and wants to make friends right away. \nFreddie sits for treats, and is extremely food motivated. Actually, dont tell Freddie, he could stand to lose a few pounds from all of that food motivation. ...but hes still perfectly adorable. He even does a cute little dance on his hind legs, and waves his front paws when hes very happy.\nBut as adorable as he is, Freddie is a challenge... one that requires an experienced owner, ideally an older couple or single... someone to help Freddie with his fears and insecurities and give him all the attention and love that he deserves. Freddie does not get along with other animals. He has separation anxiety. He will occasionally guard a possession... sometimes something as silly as a tissue. And Freddie can be vocal so he will not make a good neighbor for an apartment dweller.\nDespite all of that, or maybe because of it, Freddie deserves love, empathy and the patience to look past his imperfections, see and enjoy the best in him, and give him a home where he will be forever cherished.\nThe biggest rewards come to those who make a commitment to a special guy like Freddie.\nHe is as lovable as he looks and is waiting to be a great best friend.\n\nMaybe you are ready for Freddie?",

She has so many stereotypes going against her that we can only think that's why she hasn't been adopted.\n\nSparkle is excellent with other dogs, cats & children big & small. She is crate trained, house trained, knows hand signals & is excellent on a leash. She is deaf & blind in one eye, she was born that way & has no 'startle' reflex, if you tap her while she is asleep she doesn't even flinch.\n\nSparkle is ready for you, her adoption fee is wavied to an approved home.\n\nPlease fill out an application at www.iRescueHomelessPets.org under the adopt tab to add Sparkle to your family forever.\n\nWe HIGHLY recommend you take your dog/puppy to formal obedience classes with a qualified trainer. This will help you and your dog/puppy learn and bond with each other.\n\nWhile we do the best to determine the breed of our dogs, the majority are turned in as strays & we have only general appearance, coat type, size, ear type, tail & coat color to base breed on. It is always possible when adopting a puppy that it can dramatically change and look like another breed as it grows up.\n\nOur fees are typically $75.00 for adult dogs & $150.00 for fully vetted puppies.\n\nFill out an application at https://form.jotform.com/40468849602159 to add this pet to your family forever.http://iRescueHomelessPets.org\n2/2/21 9:31 AM",

Does great with other dogs at daycare, but is fed separately as she can get possessive with food. Former street dog from Puerto Rico, rescued in 2017, and she is a fast runner so fenced in yard is required, as well as harnessing and keeping her safe on walks. Has done well with kids, but not tested with young children. She does not like crates (and will rub herself raw trying to get out) so ideal person would either be retired, work from home, or take her to daycare.

I love all toys especially the squeakers and I'm good at pulling them out and showing you. I love to play rough with my other furry friends as well as ropes and balls etc. I love kids but with my energy level and my jumpiness I should probably be in a home with kids 10 years and older. The young ones don't like me in their faces when I jump. I overall am a happy girl. It doesn't matter what's going on my tail doesn't stop. Please pick me as your new fur baby and I promise you I will keep you entertained for hours. We are a foster based organization and DO NOT have our adoptable pets at HALO. You must complete an adoption application to meet the cat or dog. We are by appointment ONLY.\n\nAdoption fee $200\n\nAdoption app: www.halok9behavior.com/forms",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Riley. I am a friendly 6 year-old who would be a great addition to your family--ESPECIALLY if you have kiddos!\n\nI'm in foster and my foster mom says I'm 'adorable.' I'm house trained, crate-trained, and enjoy my neighborhood walks. I'm good with children of all ages, and would really love a family where the kids would play with me.\n\nI am a sharpei-mix (maybe with a little hound?). I'm a goofball, but I've had some training and like to show off my commands. During the day I sleep on my \"place\" while my foster mom works. I like car rides, and I like to go on leash walks with other dogs in the neighborhood!\n\nIf you live in the L.A. area and would like to meet me, my rescue will bring me to your house for a meet-and-greet!  You can contact them here, or go to https://outtathecage.org/applications.\n\n I hope you pick ME!--Love, Riley.",

            "description": "MEET KITTY!\n\nKitty is a beautiful 3 year old girl looking for her furever home. It appears Kitty was a backyard dog, so she'll need a patient owner who understands this and work on Kitty's training. She is a friendly girl, but is cautious and timid at first. She needs an owner who will show her she can trust humans and she doesn't need to be scared anymore! Kitty can jump a 6 foot fence so she'll need a home without a doggy door, at least at first, and someone supervising her while she is outside. Since Kitty has been at the shelter, she has shown great improvement. She is easy to leash and walks very easily. She loves to sniff everything and when she comes back to the shelter, she likes to go to the play yard so she can get some more lovin' before she goes back in her kennel.\n\nKitty came in with another dog (Dragoon), and while she appears too scared at the shelter to play with Dragoon she is friendly with this dog. If you are interested in Kitty and have dogs currently a meet and greet is strongly encouraged. Kitty has a lot of life left to live and a lot of love to give! She needs someone to step up and show her how great her life can be! Are you that person? Come meet Kitty today!\n\nUnderdog Rescue does not physically have this dog in its possession. To visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show. We have been told that you can go straight to the shelter and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog. From what we understand, the shelter will squeeze you in except between 12-3PM and near the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog. We hope your adoption process is smooth and full of happiness!\n\nThis amazing pup is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4480645\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

            "description": "This handsome boy is guessed to be a year old shepherd mix. He is approximately 55-60 lbs of playfulness. He is doing well with the other two dogs in his foster home but it a little bit higher energy than they like. He would do great with another high energy dog to play with. He is doing well on house-breaking and knows sit and shake paw. He is smart and needs some leash training and general-manners training as he is full of energy and spunk. He is very sweet and non aggressive. Unknown how he'd be with cats. May be too much energy for small children as he doesn't seem to know his size. He's a happy go lucky, affectionate boy\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Swifty complete the Adoption Application on our website at www.NeedyPaws.org and we will contact you. Adopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nSwifty's adoption fee is $250.00, which includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

He had ear, skin, and eye infections but he's all fixed up now! Soon after being rescued, Jesse was adopted by a wonderful man. Sadly, his daddy is terminally ill and Jesse finds himself with the rescue and once again, searching for a home. He is a sad, confused baby right now.\n\nHe would do best in either a household on his own, or with a female dog his size. This gentle and loving boy would love a place to call his own. Jesse is your typical Velcro-Dobie, he loves being with his people and getting his fabulous ears scratched.\n\nFor more information on Jesse, or to set up a meet and greet, please call or text Ginny at 954-295-7536 between 7pm and 10pm. You can also fill out an application on our website at www.doberescue.net.\n\n*Please keep in mind that this is a volunteer run organization.

This girl is a tough cookie as when she came to her foster mom she couldn\u2019t even stand on her own. \n\nSummer is very outgoing and excited to meet everyone. One of her favorite activities is playing with toys.  Summer doesn\u2019t live with kids or cats, we think older kids just because she\u2019s energetic. She loves other dogs and would look for one to match her energy level or be tolerant of her puppy like behavior.  Summer's foster mom says she's a lap dog and when its time to chill out, you wont have to look for her as she will be right there with you. \n\nIf you are looking for a spunky girl, look no further than Miss Summer. \n\nYou must be over 21 and a home owner to adopt me. Please visit www.pittiesandpurrs.org to fill out an application. For further information contact adoptpitties@gmail.com",

I love going for walks with my foster mommy and she thinks it is funny when I playfully tug on my leash as we head out the door. I'm still working on my house training but once I get relaxed in my new home and you have a little patience with me I should be fine. I'm great with other dogs and my mommy thinks that based on my personality I would be OK around cats too. I don't know. I don't think I've ever met a cat so that remains to be seen. For the most part I'm pretty good with anything that comes my way. Now that I feel better I'm a much happier girl and just thankful to be alive.\nIf you think you'd be interested in becoming my forever family please send an email to fureverangels@aol..com and request an application. I'm really looking forward, for the first time in my life, to see what great things lie ahead for me.",

If you intend to adopt a dog and want the new dog and your current dog to meet, that can be scheduled with the help of your Adoption Counselor.  Thank you! *****\n",

He had a tie out wrapped around his abdomen and penis, which caused his prepuce to start dying. He had surgery to repair this and while his penis looks slightly different, it does not impair him in any way.  He urinates like normal and is not disfigured. \n\nWhen he first arrived at his foster mom\u2019s, he was fearful of walking outside by himself and coward when he had an accident. He has overcome that. He is just a baby and still figuring everything out. He is currently working on crate training, potty training, not jumping and sitting. He is extremely loving, gentle, has the most beautiful eyes that speak to your soul, loves any attention and especially loves to have his face held in your hands and his belly rubbed. He gets along with other dogs, but sometimes does not know his limits and does not take correction from other dogs. He is eager to learn.",

He is approximately 8 years old, tested very well with other dogs at the shelter but is NOT good with cats. Please check back in soon for updates on Tucker!! 11/2: Tucker arrived at his foster home and is getting all acquainted and adjusted to foster home life :) He gets along great with his foster furbrother Ernie and has discovered that lounging on the couch is one of his new favorite things. He saw the vet to get his eyes checked out...the vet feels that he is most likely completely blind in his right eye. He has a detached lens and atrophy of the retina. He also has a cataract in his left eye so sees somewhat limited in that eye. The vet also says that it looks like he had an abnormal reaction to dilating drops in that left eye at some point which left his pupil permanently dilated. It doesn't seem to bother him and he gets around great so his eyes have likely been this way for a while. 12/15 UPDATE from Tucker (now known as Bert)'s foster mom....Bert has settled right in to our household. He's a laid back guy and, while he loves going for walks, he seems to really like hanging out with the family and being a total couch potato. He isn't a demanding dog in terms of exercise. He is a real love bug and wants to crawl right into your lap (all 78 lbs!) and snuggle.\nHe does have vision problems, which is apparent when you look into his eyes, but he gets around just fine. He seems to see pretty well, even at night. He has no trouble crawling into bed in the dead of night. I have seen him bump into things on his right side (his worse eye apparently) but he will chase a ball fine and I've seen him chase squirrels as well.\nHe isn't picky with his food, he'll eat whatever you put down in front of him. But he is kind of itchy, so we are trying out a grain free diet to see if this will help.\nHe walks well on a leash, but does have problems when another dog crosses our path. He will bark and pull. We are doing some training with a gentle leader to see if this will solve this issue.\nBert requires some warming up to other dogs, but he gets along great with our young male Ernie. They frequently cuddle together on the couch.\nBert would be a great dog for a family who wants a more laid back, easy going boxer.",

Vanessa was a little snarky with high energy dogs that she was temperament tested with at the shelter but with a foster offer for her who understands that, we were able to pull her into the rescue. She is not spayed yet, which could be part of the behavior and/or she may not be feeling the best due to testing positive for heartworm disease, plus she just looked terrified in her intake pictures. One look at that scared face and we just knew we had to help her. Vanessa has started on pretreatment medications and she will be seeing the vet very soon to get all checked over. FROM HER FOSTER MOM: Vanessa is doing great. She's in her shutdown period. She's learned the routine fast. There's never a peep out of her in the crate. Matter of fact she hasn't even barked one time. She did have an accident in her crate last night after she was out a hour earlier and pooped outside. I am pretty sure it was because we overfed her at dinner time. So totally our fault. Lesson learned. She's so sweet. All she wants to do is be loved on. She's going to be a total love bug. She's just happy as she can be though! She's not scared now. She just smiles and wags that tail!2/2/21: Vanessa is learning the ropes at her forever foster home and is feeling a little better about things. She is currently undergoing heartworm treatment.",

I came to RAIN very sick with an autoimmune disorder and skin infections which makes my skin a little patchy, even though I am all healed up now. I can be a bit shy and anxious sometimes but I am a sweet boy who needs a stable home and training. I am neutered, UTD on vaccines, dewormed, current on flea/HW preventative, and microchipped. I am good with other dogs, cats, and children. Won't you please give me my forever home?Thank you for your interest in our adoptable pet. Please note that while we do our best to describe the pet in detail, some items such as breed and age can be \"\"best guesses\"\" since many of our animals come in without previous records. RAIN does not guarantee size of our animals at adult age nor will we guarantee breeds of animals.",

I am an adorable, lovable spayed Great Pyrenees mix. I am a very sweet but shy girl. I lived a majority of my life outside so I am still adapting to what it is like to be loved and kept inside of a home. I seem to be housebroken so that is a plus. I would do okay with other dogs my size that know to give me space. I do need to be watched with toys and food because sometimes I don't want to share. I would be okay with older kids or adults only. I would also LOVE a fenced-in yard so I can run around. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please fill out an application today. XOXO Bindi\n\nLocated in the West Bloomfield, MI area. \n\nAdoption application: https://us01.sheltermanager.com/service?account=ah0334&method=online_form_html&formid=5\n\nAdoption fee: $350To complete an adoption application, go to: http://almosthomeanimals.org/applications/adoption/",

            "description": "Billie\nMale\nTerrier mix\nBorn 2019\n\nContact Kate at kmolsbe@gmail.com for more information about Billie.\n\nYou have heard the phrase \"Looks can be deceiving\"?  Well, Billie is the perfect example of that phrase!  Looking at his pictures below, you would say he is shy and fearful, telling you \"please don't look at me\"!!  Get him in his foster home environment and he is a completely different dog - playful, scampering around with his new buddy Winston, getting into mischief at every opportunity - a happy little guy!  Billie, as well as his brother Willie, were extremely shy of humans when they came to NMAF from a rural shelter where they found themselves after being picked up as strays.  We have no other information beyond that.  It took time for them to adjust, Billie coming along faster.  Once they were separated into different foster homes, both have made great progress in dog and human socialization.  Billie's foster mom calls him a little hooligan - he is always looking for some form of mischief to get into!  Leave your shoes out - Billie will remind you not to...  Have your sweater on a chair, he just might claim it for his own!  Billie is a young pup and still has that puppy energy and inquisitiveness.  He is still shy of new people but, given time and another young playful dog in his Furever Home, he will come around.  Super smart and cute as a button, whatever Terrier mix he is, is NOT hypoallergenic, so please don't inquire if you are seeking a hypoallergenic dog.  Billie should not be an only dog and would do best with playful doggy playmates near his own size.  He will take time and patience to adjust to new surroundings, and training/coaching will be provided.  He is neutered, up-to-date on shots, and microchipped.\n\nBillie would do best in a home without young children as he is skittish and shy at first.  His doggy brother(s) or sister(s) will show him the way to adjust and help his family see what a bright and happy little guy he is.  Trust is one of the hardest things to build in a dog, but Billie has shown he can do it and will continue to improve in the right environment.  NMAF can also offer professional trainer options to help with socialization & training.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Billie, please complete an application, found at www.nmaf.org/adopt/adoption-application, and email it to dogs@nmaf.org.  There is no commitment or guarantee for adoption, but your application allows for screening before setting up a meet & greet with his foster.\n\nBecause home visits are required, NMAF dogs cannot be adopted out of the greater Albuquerque / Santa Fe area.\n\nAdoption Clinic Location:  PetSmart - Academy & Wyoming, Saturdays, 10:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. - Currently Suspended\n\nPlease visit our website at www.nmaf.org for more information.",

            "description": "***Sunshine is only available through our Foster to Adopt Program***\n\n\nHi, Sunshine here! I am just an itty bitty little, 10 year old chihuahua/mix. \n\nI was a stray dog in Alabama, so I am leery of people and other dogs. I am finally learning to trust people again. I am quiet, well mannered, and am NOT a barker. I'm learning all about living in a house and I'm doing great. Foster Mom says I'm just about house trained so she's very proud of me. I'm working really hard and I know I'll master it soon! I had 13 bad teeth removed, so I am finally enjoying eating again. I am also heartworm positive and am in the middle of my treatment. I'm doing great and can't wait to get a negative test result. The treatment is covered by Warrior Dog Rescue. \n\nI would love to find a home with adults who will give me love and patience, so that my award-winning personality can shine through. I will need a fairly quiet, low-key home, especially during my heartworm treatment, to promote healing. I know I could make a wonderful addition to someone's family. Could that be yours?\n\n\n\nFOSTER TO ADOPT:\nSunshine is in the middle of her Heartworm treatment. After her treatment is completed, she will be tested periodically and will wait for a negative test result which can take 2-9 months after treatment. During these months, she will need to make sure her heart rate is not elevated due to high energy play or exercise. Sunshine is only available through the Foster to Adopt Program at this time. The commitment will be for an adoption but will be fostering until she is cleared with a negative Heartworm test result. All of the medical expenses will be paid for by the rescue while she is in a foster to adopt home. Food, kennel, grooming and other supplies will be provided by the foster in the foster to adopt program. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $400\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

I am looking forward to finding a new quiet adult-only home with a mature individual or couple who wants lots of unconditional love and a loyal companion.   I am a senior...I can't deny that. I am also losing my sight.  But I still have a good quality of life that I would like to share.  Because I don't see well anymore, I need some time to adapt to my new home and how to get around. If you happen to have another little dog, maybe he or she could help me! I am a special boy and if you give me a chance you will have a grateful friend who would will snuggle in your lap and sleep in your bed  if you don't mind.   If you would like more information about me, please call Sandy at 661-824-4495 (this is a land-line phone). I hope to meet you soon!",

Cruiser found himself on the euthanasia list at a kill shelter in Houston TX after he was found wandering around. A group of people saved him. His owner was later tracked down and they said they didn't want him and gave no reason why. Cruiser is very sweet and after he warms up loves his humans. Cruiser is in a foster home in the Puyallup, WA area and we've learned more about him. He is definitely an alpha dog which means he needs to be the leader as he is dominant. He has a very HIGH prey drive, so no smaller dogs and NO cats. He okay with dogs his own size, but need slow and patient introductions.  When he does not want to do something- like putting a harness on him- he will let you know by growling or raising his lip. He has not shown any aggression towards his foster mom, but is able to tell her when he's not a fan of something. We think kids would over stimulated him so we are recommending a home with no kids. \nSo those are some quirks that he has so let us tell you about Cruiser's very positive traits. He is wicked smart and very food motivated. His foster mom is working with him on clicker training. He loves humans and is extremely eager to please. He walks well on leash, but he is very strong. His ideal home would be very active and giving him a place to run and play. His foster mom describes him as a very loving and sweet dog who deserves the right home. He will need continued training and patience. . We would love to find him a home that won't abandon him as he deserves a family of his own.\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application if you are interested in Cruiser \nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

Cruiser found himself on the euthanasia list at a kill shelter in Houston TX after he was found wandering around. A group of people saved him. His owner was later tracked down and they said they didn't want him and gave no reason why. Cruiser is very sweet and after he warms up loves his humans.Cruiser is in a foster home in the Puyallup, WA area and we've learned more about him. He is definitely an alpha dog which means he needs to be the leader as he is dominant. He has a very HIGH prey drive, so no smaller dogs and NO cats. He okay with dogs his own size, but need slow and patient introductions.  When he does not want to do something- like putting a harness on him- he will let you know by growling or raising his lip. He has not shown any aggression towards his foster mom, but is able to tell her when he's not a fan of something. We think kids would over stimulated him so we are recommending a home with no kids. \nSo those are some quirks that he has so let us tell you about Cruiser's very positive traits. He is wicked smart and very food motivated. His foster mom is working with him on clicker training. He loves humans and is extremely eager to please. He walks well on leash, but he is very strong. His ideal home would be very active and giving him a place to run and play. His foster mom describes him as a very loving and sweet dog who deserves the right home. He will need continued training and patience. . We would love to find him a home that won't abandon him as he deserves a family of his own.\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application if you are interested in Cruiser \nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

Odette was adopted from us as a small puppy, but unfortunately found herself homeless and at a local shelter. Thanks to her chip, she was able to get back to us since the owners no longer wanted her. She is ready to find a family who wants to love her furever! \nOdette is spayed, current on her vaccines, heartworm negative, microchipped, and on flea and heartworm prevention. Her adoption fee is $175.\n**Application to begin adoption!** (Applicants are contacted in the order we receive responses.)\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1l55Ts1AJ_ijHnV8BwF-CzzLDJr7zynGOKiNC6wMTFgQ/edit",

Proper introductions to new dogs are encouraged. Tallulah is an active girl and loves to play and enjoys toys. She was adopted from us as a small baby and sadly, ended up at a local shelter. She would like to find a family who will be committed to loving her and giving her the time and attention she needs.\nTallulah is spayed, current on her vaccines, heartworm negative, microchipped, and on flea and heartworm prevention. Her adoption fee is $175.\n**Application to begin adoption!** (Applicants are contacted in the order we receive responses.)\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1l55Ts1AJ_ijHnV8BwF-CzzLDJr7zynGOKiNC6wMTFgQ/edit",

He didn't have a family to go home with but within a few days, he was welcomed into a foster home with one of the veterinarians who cared for him.    \n\nWe estimate Chevy\u2019s age to be around 4 years old.  He currently weighs 95 pounds, is already neutered, and tested negative for heartworm disease a few weeks ago. He\u2019s been taking monthly preventatives. \n\nChevy is housebroken, crate trained, loves being with people, and is great with other dogs.  He sleeps right through the night, doesn\u2019t counter surf, is very respectful and eager to please. \n\nChevy is an awesome companion and a true joy to spend time with! \n\nHis foster mom shared: \n\n\u201cHe is the biggest, cuddliest love bug who wants to sit on your lap and hang out with you.  Super dog skills, very sociable and amicable with other dogs and people. Doesn\u2019t bark but loves to \u201ctalk\u201d. He does the Shepherd talking & it\u2019s very cute. (Video coming soon).  Gives very gentle kisses and takes treats so nicely from your hand.\u201d \n\nWe do not provide DNA testing which is the only way to know with certainty which breeds are in his genetic background.

She came to us with a split tongue and a clearly painful hind end. Thankfully, our lovely medical partners have created a long-term management plan that has been working so well that today, we would never know she had these challenges!\nMilady exhibits many characteristics of a Malinois, and breed experience is preferred but not required. She is an incredibly smart girl who needs an owner ready to keep her brain engaged. Milady has really blossomed during her stay with us, and we can't stress enough how silly this girl is once she feels comfortable! Milady enjoys prancing along and stopping to sniff the flowers on long walks, the occasional zoomies, and being told she's a good doggo. I mean, who wouldn't?\nMilady will need something specific to be successful in having the best life she possibly can. After all, she deserves just that, doesn't she? Milady would do best as an only-pet, and will require a home with older, dog savvy children or an adult-only residence.\nMilady has a consult prior to her adoption, so give us a call at 509-374-4235 to learn more about her!

Inquiries will not be answered at this time.\n\nMongo is an older fella that came to us in very poor condition.  He was mangy, emaciated and have wounds all over his body.  We estimate him to be around 5-6 years old.  Life has not been kind to this boy, and he really has never had real love until reaching our shelter.  He has run as a wild dog most of his life.  Upon coming into our facility he really wanted nothing to do with people and did not trust us at all.  He has many skin allergies and requires to be on a special diet that can be a bit costly per month.  We will supply you with the first bit of food for him.  He gets sore from time to time and will need an anti-inflammatory to help ease the pain some days.  Mongo has really decided to trust us and he wants nothing more now than to be with his person.  He does well with female dogs, he does not really interact with them but he can co-exist peacefully.  No small animals or male dogs for Mongo.  If you think you have the right home for Mongo please fill out an application.  We truly want him to go to the best home that can afford his medical/food needs on a monthly basis.  We know he can show you his big heart if given the chance.  (His favorite thing to do is sleep on warm fuzzy blankets on his bed) He LOVES naps! Please research POSITIVE training techniques before applying to adopt. We care very much about your application answers and they are reviewed for completeness and the best match.   Please fill out an application on the included link: https://threerivershs.org/adoption-app-2/\n\nThe adoption fee of $175 includes spay/neuter, current vaccines, microchip, free vet visit, 30 days of pet health insurance, puppy book, and engraved ID tag.\n",

He is finally opened up enough to start playing with them at times!\nGood boy, Dime!!!\n\nUpdate 01/14/2021:\n\nDime has had many visitors, but nobody that has understood that Dime will not be a companion animal right away. He will need LOTS of time to decompress at his new home, and to get to know you. He is not the type of dog to run up for affection, or to take out on walks just yet. (he bites through and will slip his leash/harness so please believe us and don't risk it)\n\nHe will need to be in a home that understands that he will need a companion animal, preferably a small or medium sized female, to help him come out of his shell.\nHe is fine with cats and all other critters from what we have seen!\nDime will NOT be good in a home with kids under 13, due to being a bite risk if he is cornered.",

He will do well with a buddy he can learn and mentor from and will benefit from a huge yard or acreage to run and play under guidance. He also needs an adopter who will commit to working with a professional trainer or who is a dog trainer who works in Postive reinforcement.\n\nRIDER is a herding dog. He needs a child-free home and would do best being a pet but living on acreage and being able to accompany someone everyday-OR be adopted into an adult only home with super active hikers and outdoor types with trips to the beach and woods frequently and 2-3 miles or more a day of daily exercise and he must have a dog Buddy. Rider is in foster care and walks several miles a day. Rider is in more of a city area at this moment and the city is stress for him, so we are seeking an urban setting, acreage, and Very active owners familiar with this breed who already own an active younger dog to be Riders BFF.\n\nRider is being fed a Human Grade and Raw Canine diet. We educate our adopters in canine and species-specific nutrition. Rider is neutered, up to date and ready for his forever home.

She has not shown the same adoration for other dogs, however, so would do best as an only pet. If you are looking for a calm, beautiful, loyal companion, please consider meeting Electra! Electra is currently undergoing treatments for heartworm disease. Until she has completed her treatments and is fully recovered, she is available for adoption only in the Atlanta area because she must be able to come to Furkids' shelter for treatments. Electra weighs 76 lbs., her estimated birth date is 8/16/2012 and her adoption fee is $75. If you want more information about Electra, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

            "description": "Deke ACCT-A-65686\nIntake:Stray\n\nBio from Foster: \nDeke is a young, medium sized pit mix that really loves other dogs. He has been with his current fosters since mid-March 2020 and is looking for his forever family.\n\nDeke can be cautious of strangers and is looking for adopters who will continue to help him overcome his fear of meeting new people. His forever family should be experienced dog owners with other dog(s) in the household to help him acclimate to a new family. Deke recently completed 8 weeks of positive reinforcement professional training to help him with his confidence.\n\nDeke really enjoys going on walks and being around other dogs. He loves to romp around the yard with his friends and can often be found sunbathing while his foster parents are working. His foster parents consider Deke to be medium energy. He does have some \"zoomies during the day but can also settle down to cuddle on the couch with his humans.\n\nDeke would do best in a low trafficked household and without young children or cats. He is potty-trained and crate trained. It took Deke about 4 months in his current foster home to not howl in his crate while being left alone as he did have some initial separation anxiety. While it was not destructive behavior, potential adopters should be aware of the noise level for neighbor purposes if their house is connected to others.\n \n\nPlease reach out to his fosters at KandPFosters@gmail.com for additional information regarding Deke and a questionnaire for potential adopters.\n\n\nThis animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs. This animal is not onsite. If the foster has not listed a personal email, contact foster@acctphilly.org to be put in touch with the foster. \n\nWe encourage you to visit our shelter during our adoption hours to view our complete selection of available animals. In preparation for your visit, please make sure to visit http://www.acctphilly.org/adopt/ to review our adoption requirements, hours of operation, upcoming events, and more! \n\nIs this your missing pet? If you believe so, please make sure to follow the instructions listed at http://www.acctphilly.org/lostpet/ so that we can make sure that you are reunited as soon as possible!",

We first learned of Sookie 8 months ago. A property owner saw her and another dog thrown out of a pickup truck abandoned in the orchards. The man admitted to shooting at her several times. She was skin and bones when found. Unable to take her in ourselves, we offered to sponsor her food during her time in rescue. At the time we had donations from The Honest Kitchen and that was the best food to help her to gain weight and get back to being healthy.\n@boxersmuttsnwigglebuttsrescue have done an amazing job getting Sookie healthy and happy again. Sookie is a boxer, 3.5 years old. She LOVES belly rubs but shes no couch potato, shed prefer being your running buddy. She knows sit, wait, come, crate and potty trained. Shes great with kids and is gentle with toys. Reach out to her rescue to learn more! \nGet to know Sookie and we are sure she will win your heart. Here is a little bit about her: \n* LOVES people, adults and kids \n* very high energy \n* needs to be the only dog. Not dog/cat friendly * knows sit\n* knows wait\n* comes when called\n* crate trained\n* is soft with toys and learning fetch \n* Loooves belly rubs",

He is friendly with everyone and is quickly learning the ropes. He loves to chew on toys and rawhides and loves to play with his humans. He does not counter surf and respects boundaries. He is kennel trained and often relaxes in his open kennel when he is worn out. He mostly sleeps in the kennel, but otherwise is good with free reign in the house. He is not sure what to make of other dogs and cats, but he often sits at the window curiously when neighborhood dogs walk by.\n.\n.\nAll animals are current on vaccinations and microchipped prior to adoption. All cats and kittens are Feline Leukemia and FIV tested. All dogs and puppies 6 months and older are heartworm tested. All animals 6 months and older are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Any kittens/puppies will have refundable spay/neuter deposits included in their adoption fee; spaying/neutering will be the responsibility of the adopter and a refund will be issued upon proof of the surgery being completed by the adopter's veterinarian of choice.\n.\n.\nKitten adoption fees are $150 (includes a $40 refundable spay/neuter deposit). Cat adoption fees are $120, unless otherwise noted. Dog adoption fees may vary between $200-250. Puppies adoption fees may vary between $300-350 (includes a $100 refundable spay/neuter deposit). All adoption fees are taxable (tax is not included in the prices listed above).\n.\n.\n\"\"Sponsored\"\" means that a donor has covered a portion of the adoption fee for that animal. \"\"Fully sponsored\"\" means that a donor has paid the full adoption fee for the animal.",

            "description": "Isn't Earl absolutely adorable with his stubby snoot and wiry coat? He is a total cuddle bug with a great personality and just wants to be your best friend! He can be interactive, talkative and energetic but also settles down and relaxes very nicely. This well-rounded, friendly fellow is a great listener and sits beautifully for treats (as you'll see on our Furry Friend Fridays segment!) He loves to catch them in his mouth!\n\nWe rescued Earl from one of the local municipal shelters. He had some hair loss on the neck which was probably from a collar being too tight. His teeth are quite ground down which can happen for many different reasons. We assume that he was probably not in the most loving and attentive of homes.\n\nEarl's only fault is being dog reactive so he will need to be in a home preferably without any other pets. Other than that, he really is the perfect companion for any family! Let's find Earl the perfect fur-ever home that he deserves!\n\nMy adoption fee of $200 includes my up-to-date vaccinations, microchip, deworming, and I come home spayed/neutered. I even started on my monthly flea and heartworm preventatives - what more could you ask for? \n\nIf you're interested in adopting me, please fill out an application on our website, PawmettoLifeline.org. Feel free to check out more of my friends or more information on PawmettoLifeline.org. The Pawmetto Lifeline Adoptions Department is open to all approved applicants on a walk-in basis from Tuesdays through Saturdays from 12pm to 6pm. Our last meet and greet is at 5:30pm. We are closed on Sundays and Mondays. We can't wait for you to find your match! Could I be the one for you?",

We are working with her now and she is adapting well to learning house manners and about socialization.   Oh and eating on a regular basis.   She is now fully recovered and can move on to to a new home. \n..\nShe was a cruelty case and the cut on her leg is from a tie out cable.    We will be updating her photos as she completes her transformation.  (photo 1) \n\n   She does have an issue with eating food too quickly, and this might take months to undo.   Her new humans must be patient and willing to bring out the best in her. \n\nYes she has a ridge on her back.  Previous owners claimed her as being a phu quoc.   However, we doubt that.   Likely a  RR x Lab.   \n\nArrival weight 24 lb we expect her to be around 40 when healthy.  She seems to have a high prey drive with smaller animals.  And would likely will be dog selective.  She is best suited for someone familiar with dog obedience training.  Not ideal for a first time dog owner. \n\nAdoption info and applications are at www.hollowcreekfarm.org \n\n",

She loves treats and playing fetch.  Amy is rather picky about her dog friends and would probably prefer a home with no other dogs.  She has a sleek brown coat and at fifty pounds is a good compact size.\n\nConsiderations\nNo children under 10 years of age",

Due to the volume of interest in our animals and the convenience we now offer of applying online for adoption, we are no longer able to reply to messages sent through our Petfinder page. MESSAGES RECEIVED THROUGH PETFINDER WILL GO UNANSWERED.\nCopy and paste this URL link to learn everything you need to know about the adoption process and to fill out the application.\nhttps://www.grandstrandhumanesociety.com/adopt/ \n\nMeet Promise\nShe is the definition of strength, perseverance and hope. Promise came in 3 weeks ago with reports of having been accidentally shut in a car door and gradually losing the ability to use her back legs. We knew that Promise would need lots of special care and around the clock attention so we reached out to several animal rescue organizations in hopes that a smaller group would have more time and resources to dedicate to this very special girl. Unfortunately no other groups had room for Promise, so she's staying with us. She told us she loves being a beach babe anyways...\nThe first thing that Promise needed was a wheelchair. The kind-hearted daughter of one of our amazing volunteers ordered one immediately!! Because x-rays showed no abnormalities, we were told we needed to have a CT scan done to see what kind of damage there was. That was done this past weekend and it looks like Promise has an inoperable spinal lesion spanning her T12 and L2 vertebrae.\nOur next steps are further confirmation testing, and discussing rehabilitation options. We refuse to lose hope that one day she could walk again.\nPromise greets every day with a huge smile, tons of kisses and plenty of tail wags. She is such an inspiration to all of us at GSHS and we are so fortunate that she came into our lives.",

My previous family could not keep me so they decided the best place for me was JRs Pups-N-Stuff. Boy were they right!! I am currently in a home with lots of other dogs that don't bother me, and cats. Also I now have a bunch of little children that want to snuggle with me. I love them all. I am house trained and I really don't need to be in a crate, I don't cause any trouble. I only bark when necessary never just because. \nI am a little dog so it does take a little bit for me to trust and warm up; I will bark and growl when someone new arrives. Give me a little space and time and I will warm up.\nIf you are looking for a great little dog I am your guy.\n\nAdoption fee: $350\n \nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit. Complete your basic training program and provide a copy of the certificate within 4 months (120 days) of adoption and we will refund $50 of the original adoption fee.\n \nAll dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing and preventative treatment, flea/tick preventative, and all required age appropriate vaccinations. As required by Wisconsin Act 90, all dogs will have received a veterinarian exam (CVI) within the past 30 days.\n \nOur adoption process requires the submission of an application. Applications and Adoption Rules can be found on our website, on the \"HOW TO ADOPT\" tab at JRsPupsNStuff.org. Upon receipt of the completed application, we will process the application including: contact with your veterinarian and completion of a home visit. Please be sure to include the contact information for your vet as we will call. If your vet requires an information release, please be sure to contact them as soon as you submit your application. We are a group of volunteers with families and jobs, so please be patient and allow a few days for our response.\n \nJR's Pups-N-Stuff Dog Sellers License 270089-DS",

She gets very excited when her foster parents get home from work but quickly settles into the snuggle bug that she truly is. She is fully crate trained and recently has been left home alone out of her crate (8+ hours) with no issues (no chewing/destruction, no potty accidents)!\n\nReba is a really smart gal and has high potential for being trained - whether that's basic or agility she would excel; she is highly treat motivated. She already knows sit, lay down and is working on stay. She needs work on come and her leash manners. \n\nLikes: Squirrels, looking out windows, destroying chew toys, romping in the snow, snuggling, wearing pajamas, grandmas + great grandmas, cheese, & other dogs. \n\nDislikes: Vacuum cleaners, water, squirrels  \n\nI would recommend she goes to a family with no kids or dog savvy, dog confident children. She is high energy which sometimes manifests as mouthy. Mouthy + high speed boinks = no good for small children.\n\n",

Todd's favorite thing to do here at the shelter is running laps out in our fenced in area. Todd seems to do alright with some dogs his size but a meet and greet would be required if you already have a dog of your own at home as he can be selective. Todd does not do well with small dogs and cats, and would probably do best in a home without small children.\n\nThe adoption fee for a dog is $100. This fee includes the dog being current on vaccinations, heart worm tested, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. The shelter is open for visitation from 10am to 5pm Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday and 10am to noon on Saturday. The phone number for the shelter is 812-376-2505",

Scared and facing an uncertain future, due mainly because of their age, Mitzi and Molly had to be wondering if their time on this earth was also about to come to an end. After receiving a call seeking help for these senior ladies, we gladly offered them a place to stay.\n\nWe were told that Mitzi was timid and we found her to be so when she first arrived. She often scurries away from people who approached her, generally retreating to her bed. Once Mitzi gives up the game of chase, she simply cowards down in her bed and allows herself to be picked up. Over the last week, Mitzi has started to feel comfortable with us and is becoming less resistant in her interaction with our staff and loves to snuggle once she feels safe in your arms and will even give you a rare kiss! Mitzi needs a calm home and would be great for a senior/retired person. She does walk well on a leash, may have some house training (but please be prepared to offer house training) and is basically a quiet, calm little girl who is truly yearning for someone in which she can feel safe and loved.\n\nMitzi was spay prior to coming to our rescue. We've updated her vaccinations, administered de-wormers and resumed her monthly preventatives. Mitzi also tested negative for heartworms during her recent vet examination. Mitzi appeared to have a slight urinary infection when she arrived and was treated with antibiotics. Other than the normal age-related ailments, Mitzi appears to be in good health for a 10 year old dog.\n\nIf you can provide a calm, secure and safe home for Mitzi, please submit an application at socorescue.com",

            "description": "Unlike her namesake, Garbo would never say \u201cI want to be alone.\u201d Garbo is a one year old girl who loves running and playing with her doggy friends and then snuggling up to her humans. At her boarding facility, Garbo is known as a \u201clove bug.\u201d\n\nGarbo loves playing with other dogs, and especially enjoys other dogs who love to run and play. Garbo likes to be around her humans or other dogs, but if that\u2019s not an option, she will settle down nicely.\n\nGarbo is mostly an English Setter and has a fair amount of the prey drive English Setters are known for. Those who have been around Garbo think she may be mixed with a dash of Border Collie. She may be OK with cats, but would need supervision and slow acclimation in a home with cats to make sure.\n\nGarbo needs all the things that an active young dog needs \u2013 lots of people time and training, plenty of exercise and stimulation, and either an active dog in the home or a person that is mostly home and who will make sure that she is socialized regularly with other dogs. She also needs a securely fenced yard with a 6\u2019 fence to keep her safe. We\u2019ve not had Izzy in a home with children and she is very active so she is only a candidate for homes with children 7+ years of age.\n\nIf Garbo has one fault, it is loving her food too much to share. Although she never resource-guards toys, she does guard her food. Food guarding is not uncommon in rescued dogs and is an issue that can be worked with, and sometimes eliminated.\n\nGarbo is crate-trained and appears to be house trained. She has basic obedience training, but is a willing student who needs to learn more. She is fully vetted and ready for a foster-to-adopt or adoptive home. Currently, Garbo is in a boarding facility near Salt Lake City. For more about adopting from SWESR, see http://www.swesr.org/Apply-to-Adopt.html\n\n\n\nFor an application to adopt or for more information about Southwest English Setter Rescue including our adoption requirements and transport availability, please go to http://www.swesr.org/. Please call us at 214-997-3885 if you have any questions.",

He also exhibits many behaviors that would indicate a previous life as an outdoor dog. He is very intense about marking, worries about other dogs, and is generally happier outside rather than inside. This means he will have to learn the ins and outs of living in a house, like housetraining and not hogging the entire couch. He is definitely not comfortable around other dogs and thus cannot be around them. Outside, he really shows off a happy, confident personality. No kids under 7 due to his age. Walks best with a harness. Needs a patient and loving adult family. Is learning house rules, including potty breaks. Loves car rides. Easily trainable. Would love a fenced backyard to explore.",

After a visit to the neurologist, it was discovered that he has Cerebellar Hypoplasia, which is a disease that denotes an inadequate development of the cerebellum. The cerebellum in dogs is a section of the brainstem largely responsible for modulating motor impulses. This will be something that can improve over time with lots of love, rehab, dedication and care, but not cured. \n\nHe is not available for adoption yet but we are accepting applications!

            "description": "Meet Theta! Theta is the possible mom, or protective sibling of the greek group. She is about 3 years old, and she is very timid and sweet. When Theta first came to rescue with her other family members she was petrified, and tried to bite anyone that picked her up. She has flourished in her foster home, but is still quiet, and very sweet. She would be okay as an only dog, but she also gets along well with others. She's very protective over her family members, and snuggles with them often. She has just started playing with toys some, and she is getting more and more friendlier every day. She would do fine with older children, but I wouldn't put her with a toddler at least long term. She might be fine I just can't say for sure. She loves treats, and loves to be scratched, but is not a fan of baths. Theta was rescued with her siblings or kids when her former owners dumped her in the middle of a busy park during the day. She goes outside well, but she will definitely need work on house training, and she can't walk on a leash well so she needs a house with a secured yard. If you're interested in meeting Theta please go to our website and complete/submit an application, and we promise to take it from there. Please allow 1-2 weeks for us to process your application, but know we are hard at work on it. Our applications can be found on our website www.okwestierescue.com\n*MUST HAVE SECURED FENCED IN YARD\n\nNOTE: You must complete and submit an application and be approved to adopt prior to being able to meet the dog. The requested tax-deductible adoption donation is $400 for our puppies, $300 for up to age 7 and $150 for ages 8 and older.\nWe do not ship our pets. Be prepared to travel to Tulsa, OK, or Oklahoma City, OK, or the location where this dog is fostered to pick up your dog in person if your application is approved. Once you are approved, you may adopt any of our dogs that is a good fit. \nWe are a non-profit organization that spends our adoption fees and donations on vaccinations, surgeries, various medical tests, medicines, food and supplies needed by our dogs. Our fees do not cover the overall expenses incurred by the care of our dogs, but they do help defray the costs involved. We thank you for your support. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always try to select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dog\u2019s needs and try to find the best match for both dog and human. \nWe leave a dog\u2019s profile online until either it has been adopted, has received several applications, or is not able to be adopted for some reason.",

You see, I was scheduled for euthanasia twice and spared both times.  Can you believe that??  Due to some kind of divine intervention, a mistake was made by a sheriff's deputy.  When the city received a boarding bill for me, they notified the sheriff and the mistake was uncovered.  Not one person involved, including the vet and vet technician had the heart to end my life. \n\nThe loving peeps at Lucies agreed to bring me to their rescue.  On the way there, I was very quiet cuz I was kinda scared.  The ladies stopped to get something to eat for themselves.  Being the sweet ladies that they are, they offered me some of their bacon and cheese covered fries, minus the bacon and cheese.  Really ladies...a plain fry??  Come on now, bring on the bacon and cheese!  Yay! Yum, yum, yum...that was the best food I have eaten - absolute heaven on earth!\n\nAnyway, I've been here awhile and learned lots of new and fun things.  I can walk with a leash and stay in my crate when needed.  I love to run and romp and play.  I am very well mannered as well.\n\nNo stubborn bones in this canine body!  Won't you give me a chance?  I'd love to have a family of my very own.  Cheese and bacon covered fries are always good too ;)\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

My first owner turned out to be like the step mom in Cinderella..except worse. You see I loved my owner and I was such a good girl so I was really confused and heartbroken when my owner tied me to a stop sign on the side of a rural road and drove off without me. I was very pregnant at the time and underweight. I waited there for 4 long days in the southern heat wondering when they\u2019d come back for me. Luckily there was a nearby business that would bring me meals everyday until animal control came and picked me up. \n\nI came to NY and gave birth to my babies. I was a good mama and took such great care of them. Now I\u2019m ready to get my happily ever after.\n\nI\u2019m a 4 year old pitty mix with a heart of gold. Despite all I\u2019ve been through I\u2019m a VERY sweet girl with so much love to give.  I\u2019m a homebody and prefer not to go out in public. I get too stimulated seeing other dogs so I\u2019d do best getting exercise in the privacy of my own fenced in yard. I\u2019m looking for a quiet home with no kids, dogs, or cats with a patient human who will love me as unconditionally as I love them. I am a little nervous because of my past. I can be shy at first but I warm up so quick once I learn you\u2019re my friend, especially when you have treats! \n\nMy nice foster tells me stories about the good life. About how there are other nice humans who always come back when they leave you. They give you meals and pets and treats. I dream about my forever human every night and I can\u2019t wait to meet them. My foster tells me Rochester gets really cold.. something about snow? I don\u2019t know what that is but I think it sounds perfect for staying in and watching Netflix.  \n\nIf your interested in meeting Winnie fill out an application!\n\nwww.operationfreedomride.com/dog",

He is looking for a breed-experienced home who has the patience to earn his trust and love. Cowboy requires some leash work and would do better as an only dog in a home with no children.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

He loves to play fetch with a ball and adores snuggles on the couch.\n\nHe has worked with a trainer for a few months and definitely is a good listener and thrives with an owner that is comfortable being the leader.\n\nWe've determined he would thrive in a home with no kids and where he is the only fur baby.\n\nHe is a sweet sweet love that just wants a family to love him back. Someone will be super lucky to have him!\n\nFor more information on Marshall, or to meet him please contact Chelsea at (310) 920-6398 or cahanrestaurants@gmail.com",

As long as the pet is viewable, we are accepting applications. No matter the outcome, we will email all applicants once the dog has been adopted. Thank you for your understanding.\n\n**\n\n\nHi there, I'm Louise! I'm a 3-year-old pitty who is simply darling although I'm a little shy. Right now, I need to gain a little weight since I'm only 45 lbs., so I'm thoroughly relishing this whole \"treat\" thing. I'm good with other dogs and cats and, even though I have a gentle disposition, kids may not be a great fit for me.  I'm also crate trained and housebroken. \n\nHere's another mark in the win column. I like to go on walks and I do well on my leash. Car rides are aweeeeeeeesome and, side note, I *LOVE* my foster sister, Bailey. My foster mom calls us Thelma and Louise. (Bailey's middle name must be Thelma). I'm a little bit of a chewer and my foster mom thinks that might be because I never had toys or chews before. \n\nToys are so cool, I like to play tug of war with Bailey. I'm not going to lie to you kind folks, I counter surf, most likely because I was never sure where my next meal was going to come from so my foster mom is teaching me that I'll never have to go hungry again and to stay off the counters. \n\nI'm spayed, heartworm negative, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped.\n\nMy adoption fee is $200",

Tucker also loves his daily walks, and looks forward to meeting other dogs along the way.  Tucker has a very \"enthusiastic\" way of playing, so he may annoy older, less playful dogs.  Tucker cannot go to a home with cats because he just can't resist chasing them.  He should be ok with kids over the age of 7, and preferably ones who have experience living with dogs.\nTucker is protective of his food, so he needs to be fed separately from other dogs.  He sleeps through the night in his crate, but he will howl when left alone in a crate during the day, so no apartment life for Tucker.\nHe really needs a home where his people are with him most of the time.  Tucker has been dealing with some medical issues that have improved a lot and seem to be under control at this time.  Our adoption counselors and medical coordinator will be glad to discuss with you in more detail.  Please submit your application to adopt adorable Tucker at www.humanetomorrow.org.",

My adoption fee of $450 includes my neuter surgery, deworming, microchip, and up-to-date vaccinations. \n\nI am a sweet guy who would feel most comfortable in a home without children or small animals. I need a home with cattle dog or working breed experience who knows exactly what to expect with a breed of a dog as smart as I am! \n\nMy adoption is considered \"Best Match\". This means that I am looking for a specific type of home or certain qualities in my new family. I am not first come-first serve for any approved applicant. Pawmetto Lifeline's adoption advocates and my case managers would love to review your application to see if we are a good fit. I appreciate your patience as the Adoption team discusses your application with my case managers!\n\nI've even started on my monthly flea and heartworm preventatives - what more could you ask for?

            "description": "Nala Came back to us January of this year. Unfortunately she had as a few altercations with the owners other dog. They loved her very much and didn't want to give her up but due to the fear of her being aggressive when it came to her food they felt it was best because they had younger children in the home. Nala came to use very very nervous afraid of us and showed some aggression to protect herself from her new surroundings. It didn't take long for nala to gain trust in a few female staff. We have been working very hard to get her comfortable around new people and slowly she is showing just that?. She has been able to be around Ruben which took her a little bit of time when she first arrived. But now she has gone up to staff without hesitation! Even our clinic staff have noticed the change in her which I awesome. Nala loves to go in water, loves walks and does good on leash, she does tend to pull a bit and like to run as well. But I think nala with the right person would be able to go up for adoption. Would definitely suggest a single female (could possibly be male), no younger kids or other dogs. But someone who is willing to come in a few times and work with her before making a finally decision or until we feel as staff she is ready to go to her new home. \nIn Nala's recent move to our building three she has changed in behavior so well. She no longer is aggressively territorial through her doors or gates. She shows excitement and playfulness when we enter her room. She has become more playful with her toys. Before she had her dental surgery she was very head shy didn't like pets on her face probably due to pain in her mouth, but after her dental she has been better with touches on her head and face. She is thriving so well with strangers she was also was a part of the Fresno State research team. Nala has come out of her shell and loves to be cuddled and loved on. She would do so well with someone who has a lot of time to give her affection and the exercise she needs. \n\nIf you think we might be a match, please visit please visit valleyanimal.org/adopt-info/ to download a Pre-Adoption Application and email dogs@valleyanimal.org to tell them that you want to meet me!\n\n Primary Color: Tan Age: 4yrs 11mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

He was living outside and also had access to the basement.  Once at the shelter, he had very little interactions with people for over a year. He was set to be euthanized, but his amazing advocates reach out to us for help. \n\nPetey will need an experienced owner. He is highly dog reactive. He needs a home with no other animals and no young children. He is a sweet boy, but he is strong, and he needs some leash training. He is getting better each day. He would benefit greatly from a fenced yard and a quiet area with not a lot of dogs around. \n\nIf you think Petey is the boy for you, please go to our website and fill out the application. \n\nhttps://www.speranzarescue.org/\n",

A good samaritan actually witnessed Emma and pups being tossed from a vehicle onto the side of the road and immediately stepped in to save them... (how could anyone be so cruel??!) \nAfter Emma's puppies were weaned and went to a wonderful foster home, they all got adopted! However, Emma still waits for her forever home. Emma is so deserving of love and a happy ever after!\nEmma is nearly 3 years old and weighs about 55 pounds. She is house trained and has good manners. She tends to get excited when meeting new people, but that's to be expected with some shelter dogs. Emma is one of the most affectionate dogs at Save A Pet and we really want her to find the perfect home!\n\nUpdate: Emma left the shelter for a trial-adoption and it was discovered that she does not like cats! (The lovely family who wanted so badly to have it work out has informed us that she is not good with cats and probably would be best as the only dog in the home as she wants all of the love for herself! )",

            "description": "Jake is a handsome 9-10 year old Beagle mix.  He will weigh around 35 lbs once he gains some much needed weight.  Jake is an extremely loving boy and just wants to be near his people.  Prior to coming to us, this poor boy lived outside, so he is just starting to learn about life in a loving home.  Since everything is new to him, he needs a patient family who will continue to show him all of the wonderful things life has to offer.  Jake walks well on a leash, is housetrained, and is working on his basic commands.  This sweet boy can't wait to finally settle in his new home.\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

            "description": "Vega is a 42 pound, 3-year-old female with smiles and charm that makes jaded dog handlers break out in giggles. She is smart, eager, loving, and most of all adorable. She will sit pretty and balance herself by putting a paw on you. Its her compromise because she really wants to love on you, but she is trying not to jump. Did we mention that she is adorable?\n\nShe loves every person she meets. She has been winning hearts with her big, starry eyes and her derpy grin. She gets along with the fosters resident dogs. She prefers to play with the female, and Vega has been mostly neutral to the male. When yard-dog antics get out of hand, a simple Knock it off, is enough to remind her whos the sheriff in town.\n\nFound as a stray in Oklahoma, Vega was still with milk, but no pups were around. Her ears are a little fly-bitten, but that doesnt take away a bit from her gorgeous expression or classic athletic build. When she entered rescue, she was nave to most of the wonderful things a Malinois should know.\n\nIt looks like for Vega, puppy training meant taking care of a few litters. She has a lot to learn, and she is an eager student. She loves attention, and training is a joy. She has picked up house-training, her new name, sit, settling in a large kennel, and she is learning to have manners with the people and other dogs in the house. She can show her hackles, but she redirects easily and improving with exposure.\n\nOf all her classes, her favorite elective is TOYS. She didnt know what to do with them at first, but now she will take the hard chew toys out of the basket and scatter them around the yard to sample. Her foster laughs describing how Vega takes the jolly ball with a rope and plays fetch with herself. She has been very good and has not tried to eat anything that belongs to the humans.\n\nThe world has been turned upside down for Vega, and she is taking it really well. She is curious and shows a stable temperament so far. A falling chair made a loud noise next to her, and she just sniffed it and went back to her own business. She is adapting to the house rules, and she is beginning to get some supervised free time inside. She likes dog beds a lot, and she loves being close to the humans.\n\nVega can get anxious at times, but that is getting better as she settles into her new home. She is almost finished with heartworm treatment and has tolerated it well. She plays with the other dogs at the foster home, and she enjoys walks and training. However, cats are a definite no-go, and small dogs probably arent a good idea, either.\n\nThere were a few instances early on when she jumped a 5-foot fence to get to the front of the house, but she never left the property. Since she learned that her foster home has loving people and OMG! TOYS! she has not tried to jump the fence again. In fact, she shows all signs of becoming a Velcro dog. For a person who loves a dog who sticks close, Vega is a dream come true.\n\nTraining Vega will be a lot of fun. She wants to learn, and she has a very soft temperament. Her foster is impressed with Vegas intelligence, and is touched by her sweet nature. Basic obedience, hiking, a playing fetch, or maybe sports would be a good fit for Vega. If you want a sweet, friendly dog with a great smile to take on adventures, this good girl might be the fit. And did we mention that she is adorable?\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please contact her adoption counselor, Teresa@madrescueinc.org.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet, please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location.

He needs a fully fenced backyard so he's not tempted to roam. Stitch would do best with older children because of his size and strength. He'd like to meet the children and any family dog before going home. His new family should be one with dog experience who can continue with his basic training. He will make a great family companion.",

Fast forward to June of this year, and we got the call about her and two other dogs ( we are unsure if they were her pups or what) chained outside, and being subject to pellet guns and who knows what else.  We rescued all three and have been working with Roxy and her socialization.\nShe is learning to walk on a leash and doing well.  Slow introductions to other dogs and she is okay but she would love to be able to be the only dog so she can be the center of a family's world, not living outside tied up where she can be the center of abuse.\nIf Roxy might be the girl to add to your family, please follow our procedures below.\n\n1. on line application\n2. vet and reference check\n3. phone call\n4. home visit\n5 meet and greet\n6. adoption\nWe will travel up to two hours to do home checks. We also truly feel the dogs in our rescue have been through enough. We take in those who are injured, abused, neglected, sick, and abandoned. That being said we search for a home that they are never put in that position again and that fits their personality and needs the best. No more hurt or fear.\n\nhttps://cliffordsarmyrescue.com/1423-2/",

No more looking from the outside in. For the first time in a very long time Storm has literally come in from the rain and the elements. Storm is now enjoying the freedom of running and walking without constraints. \n\nNo doubt Storm is absolutely beautiful. More importantly, Storm's rescue family brought back trust, love and light.  What a difference love makes!  Storm's once dull coat shines and glistens. It's amazing what love can do. Those once hopeless but hopeful eyes now shine brightly.  And Storm? Well she feels as blessed for the family who saved her as they do with her presence.\n\nStorm would do well with children over 6 and would thrive with another sweet dog. Storm had been alone day in and out for so long that we feel she would thrive with another canine buddy to hang with. We promise it won't take away from the never ending love that Stormy has to give. Gray skies are sure to clear up when you adopt Storm and we promise that YOU will definitely put on a happy face.\n\ncc: 10/21/2020",

My great rescuer Alljoy4paws literally saved me the last possible minute before euthanasia! I was very kenneled stressed and nervous in the shelter so they were scared of me but I was more scared of them! I had a feeling I wasn't safe although they took me out to the yard and I played nicely and had fun with a ball. I'm a good boy and nobody likes being locked up. I gave my rescuer so many kisses, if only the shelter could see me now when I feel safe. I\u2019m better off to be the only dog, as I am more tolerant with other dogs, and didn\u2019t really have the opportunity to play with them in my puppyhood, so I\u2019m still learning and better my social skill and play style.  just really want a happy home, either foster or adoptive, who can give me the needed feeling of being and feeling safe, and happy, preferably no young kids, for some of them do not know how to respect me. I want to have someone to love, take me on walks and cuddle me so I know I'm loved. I am a very sweet soul, have been through a lot . I have made huge strides in the last couple months, and I need a husky savvy family, who has patience and understands what I need to get me to the optimum level, since I\u2019m not perfect yet! I\u2019m sort of weary of strangers and want to take time to warm up to them, but once I get to know you, you\u2019re my best friend! \nI\u2019m ready to go, neutered, microchipped and current on vaccines. \nPlease contact Alljoy4paws about me, just email them: alljoy4paws@yahoo.com",

Emails only.\n\nIf you have applied to adopt another dog from our organization and you are interested in this dog, please email to let us know you have an application on file. If you do not have one on file, please fill one out here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form\n\nThis is Asena. She is a stray from turkey. She is around 2 and a half years old. Asena is a confident, outgoing and friendly girl. We haven't been able to test her with kids but it is suspected that she'd do well. She has been around other dogs for quite some time and she does very well with others. She is an alpha female, so would likely do best in a home with a submissive dog or as the only dog. She loves to play fetch. She has a great temperament.\n\nOur adoption fee is currently double the amount it normally is (during non-pandemic times), and for good reason. Because we do not have any flight volunteers (people flying from Turkey to Canada and offering to bring our dogs with), we are having to fly people from Canada to Turkey to get the dogs. We have to pay for each person's flight to Turkey and back, as well as roughly $600 per dog to fly. This totals at about $4000 per flight. The adoption fee currently is $900 CAD. It will go back down next year when things go back to normal and we have flight volunteers.",

He really knows and understands what is expected of him inside of a home. For not living inside of a home for so very long, he really does make himself comfortable.\n\nXavier is looking for a home where he can be the center of attention, without other dogs or cats, and a home without children. After being abused and neglected for the majority of his life, and then sharing the attention of the amazing volunteers and staff at Knox County Animal Shelter, we feel that this boy deserves to be the only dog in the home, with adopters who understand how special he is, and who can provide the love and attention he deserves.\n\nAre you looking for a middle aged, goofball of a dog to share your days with? For a companion that knows how to unconditionally love? Because I can promise that the love you give to Xavier, you will get in return tenfold. Are you Xavier\u2019s hero?",

We are hoping there is a family out there who can love us even though we aren\u2019t puppies! I am fully house trained and crate trained and friendly with all other animals.\n\nThe adoption donation fee is $250 which is tax-deductible and goes towards the care of homeless pets with Pals for Paws. \n\nTo expedite the adoption process you can fill out an application online at www.palsforpawsinc.com/adopt. Please note the adoption application doesn\u2019t bind you to anything. Pals for Paws reserves the right to refuse any adoption application for any reason and at any point in the adoption process. \n\nTo view our other wonderful Homeless Pets visit www.palsforpawsinc.com/pet-list ALSO be sure to LIKE Pals for Paws on Facebook at www.facebook.com/palsforpaws.inc \n\nAll Pals for Paws Rescue animals are fully vetted:\n*Spayed/Neutered\n*Groomed\n*Shots updated plus Leptospirosis \n*Micro-chipped\n*Dewormed \n*On Heart-worm prevention\n*On Flea and Tick Prevention\n* Dentals are done if needed  \n\nYou only need to see your vet for a \u201cmeet n greet\u201d of your new family member and to turn in their medical records.\n \nPals for Paws is a 501(c)3 animal rescue. Every penny donated and every penny received through adoption fees goes right back into the organization. There are times when the volunteers have to dip into their pockets to help the animals. We do not euthanize because a pet is sick, heart-worm positive, or has a broken leg; we fix it all, big and small. We strive to go above and beyond when caring for and socializing our animals. We understand the importance of getting to know each and every animal available for adoption in an effort to place them in the most perfect home possible. \nIf you are looking for a particular type of dog or have special needs, We can help!

This awesome dog is ready to put the past behind him and begin his new life being loved, cherished and respected. Please visit https://www.givinggrid.com/gqyawi to read Rexy's story.\n\nOur Rexy is absolutely enchanted by a good game of fetch the ball! He'll play for as long as he can with any willing partner! A fully fenced yard would be best for this guy. He enjoys short walks and appears to have an extensive vocabulary.\n\nOur handsome Rexy is 7 1/2 years old, microchipped, heart worm free, up to date on all vaccines and will be neutered upon adoption. He is currently at our Freeport location. If you would like to meet this wonderful dog, please download our adoption application and email the completed form to adopt@bobbicares.org.

            "description": "Sheriff Is in town! \n\n50lbs of love, loyalty and low-maintenance. \n\nEveryday he trusts more and more. He's still looking for his family... whoever adopts him will score a diamond in the rough.\n\nSheriff is a young dog but looks a little older due to his lifestyle living and fending for himself after years on the streets. He is such a good dog. He is super easy, chill, doesn't bark. He would make a great companion dog. He sleeps in his crate and doesn't make a peep. He is learning the comforts of living in a house.\n\nHe is mild-mannered and gets along great with dogs and kids. Not sure about cats but I bet he'd be fine. He's doggie door trained and spends a couple hours each day in his crate - though he'd much rather be hanging out with his friends. He's highly motivated by food and we are learning we must wait our turn and \"sit when treats are handed out! He loves his food!!! Due to his history, he is learning all the things most dogs learn as pups. He has been working on leash training and just went on his first road trip and was the perfect companion.\n\nSheriff \n2 year old shepherd mix \nHW positive going through treatment \nEasy going \nGreat with dogs \nLoves naps\nJust wants to love and be loved \n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

I am a one and a half year old pittie girl and currently weigh around 45 pounds. I can be a little shy when I first meet you, so I am looking for a family that will be patient with me as I get comfortable with you and in my new environment. When I get to know you, you will see just how loving, sweet, and wiggly I am! I love to play with my toys and show them off to you!\n\nI am looking for a home with no cats, and need to be the only doggie in the home to soak up as much love as I can get! My adoption fee is $250.00. I am spayed, microchipped, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and up to date on all vaccinations.",

Her original family were unable to keep her (they had her from birth), and surrendered her to an organization. She was just arriving at a foster home when she slipped her collar and ran off onto the streets. For four days she was running around frantically and was finally caught. \n\nWe arranged to take her as a transfer from the other group and now we're trying to find a home for this funny, silly, lovable JRT mix who will need an experienced home, and one willing to do some training with this little gal.\n\nLUNA has some great qualities - she adores the people she is with, bonds very quickly to those she trusts, and is terrific with other dogs. She is house trained, and is super easy in many ways. She is playful, loves toys, loves to snuggle and be close. She enjoys car rides and nothing excites her more than a hike on a trail or a beach to romp on. She is a high energy young dog so needs an active home, preferably as a second dog.\n\nBut, LUNA has a high level of 'stranger danger' when she sees strangers - on the streets, on the trails or approaching a vehicle she is in. She is genuinely afraid of strangers and can growl, bark, even run up to strangers barking (which can scare folks!), and like many other dogs, is worse with her reactivity when she is on leash. \n\nThis may be a result of not having been well socialised enough with a wide range of people when she was a young pup, or it could just be who she is - but we also feel that this is a behavior which will diminish over time with constant reinforcement that strangers can be the bearer of good things! We know this dog has a heart of gold, but she does have some anxieties that need work.\n\nIf you are experienced, and have another dog or dogs who would love a playful fun companion, and are looking for a small but active energetic dog, she might be right for you! We do not recommend children because of her current fear of strangers...",

            "description": "Some of you might remember Sawyer, an eight-year-old, 39-pound German Shepherd mix.  He originally came to Home Fur Good in early October.  Sawyer is a bit of a conundrum.  He started out being turned in as a stray to the county shelter.  He was very briefly adopted out twice before being returned and then arriving at HFG.  Sawyer has been in a home with a family for a little over a month.  He has come back with mixed reviews.  His adoptive mom said he was the best dog she ever had.  Yet, Sawyer showed signs of aggression towards strangers who came into the home.  HFG had a dog behaviorist assess Sawyer, and it appears that Sawyer will protect his home and people.  He needs a home with dog experience and experience in training dogs through unwanted behaviors.  Sawyer\u2019s most recent home had teenage children and he was exposed to friends popping in and out.  It's important to note that Sawyer is not fond of men. In fact, he would do best with a home that has zero men.  Zero men that will live with him and zero men that will visit, or a home that can safely separate Sawyer from male visitors.  Sawyer\u2019s ideal home will be one that has a slower pace and less company for him to have to meet.  HFG\u2019s dog behaviorist, from Couth Canine, is willing to work with the person or persons looking to adopt Sawyer. George is willing to consult with them and help set Sawyer up to succeed.  Sawyer knows sit, down, and possibly more; he is just keeping his tricks a secret.  His eyes light up when a ball bounces by, and he is very playful.  Sawyer is a collector of squeaky stuffy toys.  He is more of a hoarder than a rip \u2018em apart kind of guy.  The more toys in his pile, the happier he is. The adoption fee is $150 and includes spaying/neutering, age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipping, and a free wellness visit at Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital. Our adoption hours are Thursday-Saturday from 11:00 am-4:00 pm by appointment only.",

Rumor is spayed, up to date on shots, microchipped, and heartworm negative and on prevention. She loves to spend time outside and play. She must have a secure fenced-in yard. Rumor is good with kids and dogs her size and larger. She does not realize her size and plays too rough to be in a home with smaller dogs. She also has not been around cats since she was a puppy but most likely would also play too rough, so a home with no cats would be best. This girl is very loving and cuddly. She enjoys spending time curled up next to you while you watch TV or read a book. Please apply at www.caninehavenrescue.org under available adoptions. Adoption fee is $250",

I am a super friendly girl who loves to receive lots of attention and affection. I do not get along well with other dogs and would most certainly do best being the canine queen of my new castle. I'd be an excellent pick for an experienced dog owner who knows what it takes to give a girl like me the best possible life. I think I could join a family with some human children, but it would be best if they were older and understood that I need my space too sometimes. I would be happy living in a variety of home environments, including an apartment, as my favorite place is most definitely going to be on your couch. I'm looking forward to a quiet lifestyle with some people who love me a whole lot and are looking to be loved in return. I appear to be well-trained, and even potty-trained. I love to go on long-leashed walks and would be overjoyed to have you accompany me.",

            "description": "This is actually 2 different litters of puppies that were dumped together in a ditch.  They were surrended to us at just four weeks old.  They were in terrible shape and fighting several infections.  It took lots of bottles, love and TLC but now at about 3 months old, these guys recieved a clean bill of health from our vet this week and they are finally ready to start looking for their forever homes! This combo litter is made up of 3 Catahoulas (one female, two males) and 5 Border Collies (three males and 2 females).  The Catahoulas may be a week older than the Border Collies.\n\nOur adoption process for puppies in a litter is a little different than you may have experienced in the past.  We have found it works best if adopters apply for the litter, not the individual puppies.  Once the application is approved, we will reach out and set up meet and greets and invite the adopters to come and meet the entire litter.  This way, the adopters can choose a puppy based on their interaction with the puppies, not just a picture.  It also allows the puppies to have a say in who will be their forever family.  Sometimes a family may have a particular puppy in mind, but when they come for a meet and greet, the connection isn't as strong with the puppy they thought would be \"the one\" and they are able to choose the puppy they click the best with.  Puppies may or may not go home with their forever family the same day of the meet and greet.  It depends on the number of approved applications and the interactions between the puppies and the adopters. The decision is at the discretion of the Board Members present at the meet and greet.\n\nThe adoption fee for these puppies is $350. This includes all vaccines (4 Distemper/Parvo, 2 Lepto, a Rabies, and a Bordetella), appropriate dewormings, microchipping and the spay/neuter surgery.\n\nWe will be accepting applications until Oct 23, 2020.  Once the application window closes, we will take the next few days to process all the applications we receive and will then be in touch to set up meet and greets with approved adopters.  We hope to have this done by October 26, 2020 however, the amount of applications we receive determines how long it takes us to process them all.  We will contact you by the email address you entered on the application, so please make sure it is correct.  If you have not heard from us by October 29, 2020, please reach out to us by email.\nHootie's Haven takes the responsibility of choosing forever homes for our dogs very seriously and always has the best interest of our dogs in mind.  We reserve the right to deny an application for any reason and are not obligated to provide a reason. While this may seem unfair, we would hate to give someone hints about how to lie on an application for another rescue so that they were approved.  For example, if someone stated that they had 47 dogs seized by animal control in the past, and we told them that was the reason they were denied, they would know to leave that off the application the next time.  Most denials are not  for such extreme reasons, but our board has decided to put this policy in place for this reason.\n\nWe also post updates on our Facebook page, so please make sure you have liked our page and are following it so that you will see the updates.  You can also go to our page to see other pictures or videos of our dogs.  https://www.facebook.com/hootieshaven\n\nLink to application\n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/22197/generic\n",

Thank goodness I had nice people to check on me. I am currently a 45 pound lap dog that is still learning basic manners, but I am very affectionate, so hopefully that makes up for it. I am such a happy guy. I get along with all dogs, and am curious about cats, and enjoy chasing them, but not aggressively. So as long as you can supervise me, we should be ok :). I love couch cuddles, but am not a couch potato. Would love a family that can keep me busy, so that I can stay out of trouble. I just want a family to share all the love I have to give, because I have TONS, and to be loved back.",

Bolt is a big bouncy fun-loving fella who is great with medium to large female dogs and loves attention from everyone he meets. He is extremely cuddly and wiggly and loves to be loved, but he is a very big ball of energy, and needs a dog savvy owner who knows how to implement boundaries. He enjoys going for walks but can pull and will need some continued training. Bolt is very responsive to corrections and is extremely food and ball motivated. His foster mom reports that he loves to snuggle and is house and crate trained. He is neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and preventatives and eager to find a family to love!\n \nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter.\n\nFor more information, please contact France at FBognon@petconnectrescue.org. \n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

While Fran is an older girl she still has energy and enjoys being able to run in the yard. In true hound fashion her recall is very spotty. Because of Fran's love of running and tendency to follow her nose she does require a large fenced yard. Fran would not do well in an apartment, townhouse, or with cats. Fran prefers the quiet country settings over the crowded sidewalks and constant sound of traffic. Fran gets along well with other dogs and all people. She is very easy going and a great companion. She is spayed, up-to-date on vaccines and preventatives and eager to find his forever home! \n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $250 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter. \n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**\n\nFor more information, call Diane at 703-618-2502.",

            "description": "Hi, I\u2019m Finley! I\u2019m a nine to 10 year old shy poodle mix with a great big heart looking for love.  I\u2019ve come a long way since being rescued from the shelter and before that mostly knowing a life of neglect. Being in a foster home has taught me the ropes of life, what it\u2019s like to get love on the daily with lots of hugs, cozy beds, and yummy meals... snack time is a definite perk!  I\u2019ve learned a lot about home-life too and trusting people by watching the other dogs in my foster home. My perfect forever home will also have at least one other dog who I can follow and learn from, and hopefully become a best buddy. I don\u2019t always pick up on things right away, but I do start to get it after repetition. My biggest hurdle right now is becoming 100 percent potty trained. I still have occasional accidents, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll catch on with time. Ideally, I\u2019ll be in a home with easy access to a fenced yard and few or no stairs. I absolutely love exploring in the backyard and sunbathing, so a grassy area is a definite must! Overall, I\u2019m in pretty good health... I was recently at the vet and had x-rays showing I have a good heart, blood work to confirm there\u2019s no health issues, as well as urine analysis and a dental. I do, however, have dry eye and will need daily eye drops.  I get around okay, but am farsighted so seeing things super close can be confusing... for instance, sometimes a small step seems like it might be a cliff to me. I walk great on a leash and enjoy going on leisurely walks, but I do need a pet-parent who is patient and understands I didn\u2019t come from a home where I was cared for in the same way as other dogs and is willing to provide guidance and consistency to help me learn.  I\u2019d describe myself as pretty relaxed and easygoing, and will do best in a peaceful, low-key home environment where I can thrive.  Being pet and held was initially foreign to me, but I\u2019ve begun to like this type of attention and really enjoy sitting on laps and having some cuddle time.  Key takeaways for my perfect forever home include another dog to socialize with, easy access to a fenced grassy area with few or no stairs, and a pet parent who doesn\u2019t mind giving me eye drops, is patient, and can provide guidance to help me live my best life. If this person is you, then I can\u2019t wait to meet!! \n\nIf you live in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area and would like to meet Finley, please complete our online Adoption Application and we will be in touch. **Please note we only adopt in Los Angeles County and you must be at least 25-years-old.**\n\nAdoption Application: http://www.beoplesbuddies.org/#!adoption-application/c1g7e\n\nVisit our website to learn more about our foster-to-adopt process: www.beoplesbuddies.org\n\nPlease no calls.

He joined us from Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab, UT, where he spent the last 6 years of his life.  You read that right, 6 years he has been at the sanctuary.  Although he loved all his caregivers there he would really love to have a home of his very own to live out his golden years.\n\nDomingo absolutely loves people and adventures.  He would prefer a home of his very own, he does well on walks and is not particularly reactive to other pups but would like to be an only pet.  No kitty cats for Mr. Mingo Man, he gets a little too excited about them.  \n\nDomingo is neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped.

He is as adorable as he is exuberant. At 15 pounds Romeo is able to indulge his charming cuddly streak on a lap but don't be fooled as he is a very athletic young dog and does best when well-exercised - he can easily complete a hilly five-mile hike in the morning, a 45-minute neighborhood walk in the evening, and still be ready for training and treats in the backyard at night. Romeo is a high-investment, high-reward adoptee with a lot of love to give who needs an owner committed to helping him mature his strong, charming little personality into a courteous and reliable family member. Romeo is a curious and fast learner who has responded well to obedience training during his five weeks in foster (as of Dec 7, 2020). Prospective parents should know and be prepared to help Romeo with food- and toy-related resource guarding behaviors that can and have escalated to lunging and biting (band-aids only, but a serious issue that needs attention). For this reason in particular Romeo would do best in a home without other little ones to \"compete\" with. He is housebroken, and while interested in other dogs is not reactive to other dogs, on or off-leash. \n\nObedience: \n- Come/sit/stay (consistent indoors, inconsistent in distracting environments)\n- Speak/hush (consistent on speak, working on hush)\n- Loose leash walking (consistent in known environments; \"come on back\" works well as a reminder to stop pulling, reset, and go slower)\n- Leave it (training stymied by reactivity to closed hands with food nearby)\n- Thank you (for picking up or taking away a valued item - steady progress over four weeks, with lunges diminishing to infrequent)\nTemperament:\n- Curious, busy, affectionate, bossy, hilarious, cuddly \n- Signature Move: Flopping on his back and gesturing wildly for tummy pets.\n- People: Initially reactive to tall men, but then warms up to them.\n- Dogs: Interested, but not reactive on or off-leash\n- Body sensitivity: After initial trust-building, loves being petted and relaxes when being held. Working on shake for minor paw sensitivity.\nHousetrained: Yes",

For details, call the Shelter at 651-772-8983**\n\nDo you have the time and energy to keep up with an active gal like me? I'm Asana, an adorable and active female Husky mix. I came to Animal Ark from the reservation, after being picked up by another rescue. Everyone is trying to help me have a chance for a wonderful life with a family who will love and care for me. Because I'm a pup, keep in mind I will need help with potty training, obedience training and more so that I can become the best canine I can be. Your patience and efforts will result in a loving and loyal lifetime companion. I should not go to a home with small dogs, or cats. Sadly, the staff discovered when I had my vet exam that I have a heart defect. It does not prevent me from acting like a normal energetic pup, and currently I do not need any medications. My condition may need treatment in 3 or 4 years though. The Vet says we'll have to see how things progress as I grow. I would be a great candidate for a foster or foster-to-adopt home. Please call the shelter to find out more!",

She is food motivated, potty and crate trained, and gets along well with both cats and dogs (in fact, we are requiring that she go to a home with other animals as other animals build her confidence). She is very timid, so takes her a while to warm up to new people. \n\nShe has fortunately spent the last few months in a foster home where she was able to undergo heartworm treatment in a comfortable place and has begun to learn that not all people are bad and not all new experiences are scary. She still has a long ways to go, so her foster family is carefully screening applicants that will be patient and understanding as she transitions into a new environment.\n\nPlease only apply if you have another dog in the home that can help Jane with her confidence and if you have a fenced in yard. These will be required for anyone interested in Jane as they are the tools that we believe will be needed for Jane to continue to grow and excel in her new life.",

They came from a small shelter in rural Arkansas, where they lived since they were puppies together, simply because nobody comes to adopt in that small town. We brought these girls up north so they can finally have the life they deserve!  They may look larger in pictures, but these girls are only around 30-35 pounds.  \nThe girls would be best in a calm and patient home where they can learn to be a part of the family.  Lil Bit and Half Pint are so loving and gentle, 5 minutes with them and you will fall in love!\n\n*We are closed to the public for viewing. Please email adoptions@pawstinleypark.org if you are interested in adopting.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please visit our website to check on their current availability: http://www.pawstinleypark.org.. Adoptions are limited to 50 miles from the shelter. We do not ship animals. Adoption fees for dogs are $125-$275 based on age. While we do our best, we cannot make guarantees on breed, exact age and house training of our dogs. Peoples Animal Welfare Society (P.A.W.S.) of Tinley Park, IL is a no-kill non-profit 501(c) (3) organization.\n\nPhone: 815-464-7298\n",

            "description": "Lil Bit and Half Pint are 2 darling sisters.  They spent 4 whole years living in a shelter!  They came from a small shelter in rural Arkansas, where they lived since they were puppies together, simply because nobody comes to adopt in that small town. We brought these girls up north so they can finally have the life they deserve!  They may look larger in pictures, but these girls are only around 30-35 pounds.  \nThe girls would be best in a calm and patient home where they can learn to be a part of the family.  Lil Bit and Half Pint are so loving and gentle, 5 minutes with them and you will fall in love!\n\n*We are closed to the public for viewing. Please email adoptions@pawstinleypark.org if you are interested in adopting.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please visit our website to check on their current availability: http://www.pawstinleypark.org.. Adoptions are limited to 50 miles from the shelter. We do not ship animals. Adoption fees for dogs are $125-$275 based on age. While we do our best, we cannot make guarantees on breed, exact age and house training of our dogs. Peoples Animal Welfare Society (P.A.W.S.) of Tinley Park, IL is a no-kill non-profit 501(c) (3) organization.\n\nPhone: 815-464-7298\n",

            "description": "Tahoe is as goofy and cute as he is big, and we just love him! This tall, dark, and very handsome fellow tips the scales at about 85 pounds.  But don't let his size concern you--he is sweet as pie!  Tahoe is happiest when he can lean on, play with, or receive treats from a person.  While he is an adult dog, he has not abandoned his youthful puppy curiosity.  Prior to rescue, Tahoe had limited experiences so he will need a patient and kind person able to provide basic obedience training.\n\nHe is a very tall dog so he may have some Dane in him too. Tahoe has made many friends with the dogs, staff, and volunteers at our shelter. He loves to go for walks well on a leash. He works hard to please you and will chase balls for you until the sun goes down. He's yet to realize that he's supposed to bring them back--something you both can work on. \n\nHere at NMAR, we don't just find good homes for our dogs, we find the the specific good home for each specific dog. While we work towards those matches, our dogs are safe and happy in foster homes, or in our home-like shelter, where they have the chance to learn some life skills and show us what they need to be happy and healthy.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:  Tahoe needs a family or a close buddy who is patient and will give him lots of attention and activity. He is super smart and loves to learn, so he needs someone who will continue to work with him on basic and advanced commands (this guy would love to work through an agility course), will continue to give him some good playtime with other dogs, and who will celebrate his exuberance. Oh, and probably a king-sized bed would be good. \n\nAdoption fee is $195 and includes: spay/neuter, parvo/distemper series of shots, rabies, bordetella, heartworm preventative while here, worming, and microchip. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting Tahoe, please visit our website and fill out an adoption application: www.northmeckanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "This dynamic duo, Buffy & Rocket, have become best friends in foster & are looking for their forever family together.  Both dogs are wonderful, sweet, loving & fun young pups.  Buffy is very timid at first, she takes longer to warms up & want to snuggle by following Rockets lead.  Rocket is very curious, confident, outgoing & is a real attention hog. Both are still pups about 9mo and 1yr old and 10lbs. \n\nThey are active little pups; up early to go potty (trained with a dog door), they enjoy the freedom to go out to run, play with toys, wrestle & sun bathe.  So an outdoor yard, a doggy door & secured fencing is required.  They bark when they play or at scary sounds & whine when left alone.  They still act like babies; chewing on blankets & stealing your shoes.  \n\nAs young pups they will need a family focused on their needs, with time to give them a ton of attention, be committed to training, give them positive encouragement, patience & understanding to help them to feel like loved family members.\n\n\nThe first step of the process is you must submit an application in order to set up a meet and great or talk with the foster family. Once application is submitted the foster parents will contact you to chat more about the dog and make sure they're a good fit and can answer any further question. The application answers most of all of our questions and can best match you. If you do not get the dog you apply for we can use your same application for 90 days towards another dog in our care and simply forward your app to that fosters \nhttp://form.jotform.com/underdogca/dog-adoption-application\n\nAll dogs will be fully vetted (Spay/ Neutered, Micro chipped, DHPP and Rabies Vaccinated) and other possible vet care prior to adoption.\n\nThe adoption fee is $300 which is considered a non refundable donation\n\nvisit us at underdogca.com or follow us on FB and IG @underdogca\nhttps://www.facebook.com/underdogCA",

He gets along very well with them, albeit they are all so much bigger than him.\n\nJack enjoys his daily walks around the neighborhood and his many forays in the fenced in back yard.\n\nJack is hard of hearing and his eye sight is not very good, but he gets around just fine once he knows the territory. He would do well in a home with another small dog and older, considerate children.\n\nJack does not care to be picked up but will tolerate it once he establishes trust. With some TLC, he warms up nicely and really loves his humans. He loves sitting next to you on the couch.\n\nHe is housebroken and loves his little crate, his man cave, with warm beds and blankets.\n\nJack loves his meals and can be quite noisy if it is prepared too slow. He also likes to bark at his foster parents when he thinks he deserves a treat which is pretty much every time he comes back in the house.\n\nJack is a wonderful little fellow who would love to find his forever home.",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Pandy! I was originally adopted from this shelter when I was less than a year old. Now I am back again, a little greyer and a little wiser. I was returned because I needed a surgery my family couldn't afford, but they loved me so much they gave me back to the shelter so I could get well. You see, my bladder makes stones if I'm not on the correct diet and too many stones are bad for a dog's bladder. I'm all fixed up and on the proper diet now. I really loved all the members of my family. in fact, it's a toss up which I like more: my family or playing in water. I can't even begin to describe how much I love water. The hose, a pool, a sprinkler...bring them on! I can't believe there are dogs that don't love water games. They are really missing out! I am a happy dog when in the loving home of my family. I do love to go for walks but there are things outside that I'm not so sure of. Some of these things are other dogs on walks, bikes, moving cars, skateboards, etc. The nice folks at the shelter have been helping me with this and my personal doctor gave me a pill to take that makes me less anxious around these things so I can have more fun on my walks. You know that song \"Girls just wanna have fun\"? Well, that's me. My family is my everything. I will bark at strangers but then I let them pet me so I guess I'm a pushover. So, what do you have to do to adopt me? You have to keep me on my prescription food, take me to the vet for regular urine checks & keep giving my my anxiety pills. Also, you need to have owned a dog before so the shelter can make sure you are used to going to the vet, you need to keep me as your one and only pet and you can't live in an apartment, condo or townhome because a girl needs her space, especially if she is gonna play lots and lots of water games! Sound like a lot to take on? I'm totally worth it, I promise!\n\nPlease note - we always take our animals back if for some reason it doesn't work in your home so we only adopt to the following Illinois counties: Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, Will.",

General is most comfortable around adults and would thrive as the only pup in the home so he can play with you all day, every day!\n\nBefore you can adopt sweet General, please complete an adoption application on our website at pawscrossedny.org! Once your application is approved, you will receive a link to schedule an appointment online. If you have any questions about General, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand we cannot hold any pet. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.

He and his brothers (Sam and Charlie) were given up by his breeder because they are not cut out to be hunting dogs (the sister Lucy was given up earlier this year). Brutus is the shyest of the bunch. He is very sweet but will need a little time to come out of his shell. He would do well with another more confident dog in the home. He is smart and learns quickly. He would be fine for a home with children as long as they are gentle. If more than one of these littermates were adopted together, we do offer a discount on the adoption fee. Brutus is neutered, up to date with shots, negative for heartworms/on prevention and crate trained. For adoption, please submit an adoption application via our website at www.myhstc.org\n\nAdoption fee is $85 which includes all vet work. If a littermate were adopted to the same home, second adoption fee would be reduced to $45.\n\nWe prescreen all applicants prior to a meeting; to be screened, please submit an adoption application to www.myhstc.org\n\nWe do allow out of state adoptions. However, we do not ship nor transport sight unseen pets for many reasons. We require travel in person adoptions.",

Please make sure to read the adoption fee below in the bio.\n\nBREEDS: We are not breed experts. The breed(s) listed for each adoptable are best guesses or suggestions.\n\nSTEPS TO ADOPT:\n\nRead the adoptable\u2019s bio below, including their adoption fee\n\nRead \u00a0ADOPTION PROCESS page under the \"Adopt\" section\n\nComplete the \u00a0DOG ADOPTION APPLICATION (located on our website RARErescue.org)\n\n*Applications will be attended to before general inquiries. We may or\u00a0may not\u00a0have time to respond to general inquiries if you have not submitted an application.\n\nWe understand that it is important to you to find the right fit for your family. We feel the same way! The application is important and necessary for this reason.\u00a0\n\nAll of our Adoptables are:\n\n*spayed/neutered\n*up to date on vaccines\n*heartworm tested if six months or older (and kept on heartworm preventative and treated for heartworms if positive when entering our program)\n*microchipped prior to adoption\n\nBASIC INFORMATION:\n\nSuggested Breed(s): Rat Terrier\nGender:\u00a0Male/Neutered\nApprox. Age or D.O.B: Approx 18 months\nApprox. Weight: 13 lbs\nCoat Type:\u00a0Short\nGood around most dogs: Yes, but has guarding behavior of food, toys and people\nGood around most cats: Yes, loves playful cats!\nEnergy Level: Medium\nFence yard may be required: Not required if leashed\n\nAny other specifics:\u00a0\u00a0\nPatrick is little snuggle nugget who has a special personality that most terrier people know well. He loves to be held and he sleeps under the covers in the bed. He also plays well with other dogs and cats. He especially loves his feline foster sister and they are hillarious when they wrestle!\n\nHowever, he is a resource guarder. If you are unfamiliar with the term \"resource guarding\", it means that he guards and becomes reactive towards a person or animal when they encroach upon his space while he is eating, playing with his toy\u00a0or sitting/lying on a person. Therefore, his person or family would benefit from having experience with resource guarding. There\u00a0needs to be some\u00a0acceptance on the part of his adopters of what works best for Patrick and willingness to work with him.\u00a0\n\nPatrick doesn't chew anything but his toys. He normally does not have any accidents when he's given potty breaks every few hours during the day and he sleeps through the night. If he's alone for more than 3 to 4 hours at his foster home,\u00a0he wears a \"belly band\" (or male dog diaper) just in case!\n\nWill you be a Hero in Patrick's story?\n\nVisit our website/Click on Adopt to APPLY today!\u00a0 RARErescue.org\n\nAdoption Fee: $185.00\n\n\n\nPlease REMEMBER, All of our Adoptables are:\n\n*spayed/neutered\n*up to date on vaccines\n*heartworm tested if six months or older (and kept on heartworm preventative and treated for heartworms if positive when entering our program)\n*microchipped prior to adoption\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We are a non-profit organization without municipal or government funding. Veterinary/Medical expenses are constant for an animal rescue. Our adoption fees not only help to provide vetting and care for the animal being adopted, but they also help to cover heartworm treatments and other treatable ailments that many animals, that would otherwise be euthanized, need in order to be made available for adoption.\n\n\n\nPlease understand that adopting an animal is a LIFETIME COMMITMENT to that animal and there will be veterinary expenses throughout their life that can often cost several hundreds, if not thousands of dollars (without pet insurance), especially without annual checkups and preventative care.\u00a0 As a potential family for this pet you are responsible for their safety and that includes keeping them on your property.\n\n***If you are not in the middle Tennessee area, transport can potentially be arranged to approved homes, depending on distance and local adaptability. We normally do not allow adoptions outside of 1.5 hours driving distance.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, foster, or aid in the rescue efforts of RARE!",

We believe her to be a pit/pointer mix (best guess ).  She is spayed, up to date on all vaccines and just completed heartworm treatment.  She is housebroken and has perfect manners in the home.\n\nGodiva is a good girl who  found herself in horrible condition when her owner couldn't or wouldn't care for her.  She had a horrible skin infection, a severe eye infection, she was heartworm positive and had several fractured teeth.  Lucky for her, her \"owner\" surrendered her to the shelter and then she entered our care.  ALL her medical needs were addressed and today she is a happy, healthy heartworm FREE beautiful girl.\n\nGodiva is now looking for a family, not an \"owner\".\n\n  Godiva would benefit from  a quiet, predictable home with not a lot of people coming and going.  Godiva likes quiet.  Godiva can be a little nervous around some men, but can warm up.  No children, as they make her nervous.  \n\nGodiva is fun and silly.  She enjoys cuddling in soft comfy beds or couches, chewing her favorite bones and warming herself in the sun.  She needs a patient adopter who will make her feel safe, secure and loved.  She needs a little time to adjust and warm up, once she does, she will be the sweetest friend.   \n\nShe can get along with calm, submissive dogs, with proper and slow introductions.  No cats or small dogs.  Godiva would also require a fenced in yard to she can enjoy her sunbathing! \n\n\nGodiva is located in Spring Hill Pasco County.   Please message us here or email us at lovetotherescueinc@gmail.com if you are interested.\n\n\n**Inquiries by email only please. We do not respond to phone call inquiries**",

They were surrendered due to no fault of their own, when their family had a baby.  They are friendly with everyone they meet and they crave attention.  These two will some serious need loose-leash training work and plenty of exercise to help keep their mind and body relaxed.  A backyard with a high fence would be ideal for them so they can run around with each other and play like typical huskies.  They are crate trained, and in their previous home they slept in the crate at night.  It is important that their new owners can give them the proper attention, training, and mental stimulation that huskies need.  We are requiring that they go home together, as they are extremely bonded.  It is important that their new family gives them the appropriate time to adjust, as they have been out of a home setting for a little while now and need patience and understanding.",

For the most part she does very well on a leash, but she does test you at times (did I mention she\u2019s smart). She just needs someone to help keep her in check or she will take off and drag you along, lol.\n\nShe isn\u2019t sure yet how to play with other dogs. She gets a little scared but definitely wants to try. Cats, squirrels, and deer in our neighborhood, those she wants to chase.\n\nShe is heartworm positive and currently undergoing treatment.  Once she is given a clean bill of health, she would do well with an active family. She does really well  with and really likes my niece who is 6. She loves people in general.\n\nShe isn\u2019t a huge fan of the crate but is getting used to it. She\u2019s very food motivated so a treat in a toy will easily get her in the crate. She likes to have a toy or something to do in there with her.\n\n***** Adoption Fee: $350 \n\n ***** NOTE to those viewing this profile on Petfinder.com: Visit our website for more information about our policies.

He is looking for a specific home and he intends to be, shall we say...picky.\n\nRalphie is a champion ball player. And he won't share his ball with just any ole person. He has to approve you. Once you're approved you've got the seal of approval for life. He bonds deeply with his human.\n\nRalphie was saved from Hurricane Harvey. He arrived in Delmarva as a part of a lifesaving transport out of the disaster zone.\n\nRalphie told us under no circumstances does he want to share his life with a kid. He owns all of the balls in the house ...and he's not sharing. His perfect parent is a pitching machine and must be up for a game of ball every night. He would prefer if you own a minimum of a dozen tennis balls because he'll play with 3-4 during one game.\n\nRalphie is quite the connoisseur. He'll appreciate it greatly if you know how to serve up the grub. He enjoys mealtime almost as much as his game of fetch.\n\nOnce you've passed Ralphie's inspection - he will lavish you with love. But know this - you'll have to earn it - and it will take time. \n\nHe is crate trained and housebroken. He is vaccinated, neutered, heartworm negative, and microchipped. He hopes you are too.\n\nMusts:\n\nRalphie must be adopted within one hour of the rescue. Multiple visits will be required. Adopter must have a fence. \n\nIf you want to swipe right on this guy - visit our website for the adoption application. www.hillhounds.org",

Please do not apply if you live in a busy city. \n\nFenced in Yard: Required. An exception can be made for a private country setting and in this case, no fence is required as long as he has supervised long line exercise and his person understands he cannot be off leash. \n\nMedical: Some food sensitivities. \n\nSpecial: Zevs will need to meet his new person a few times before moving to his new home. As such, applicants must be within 2 hours drive of Ottawa and must be willing to come to Perth a few times to meet him. Zevs is a RAD (Recovery Adoption Dog) due to his difficulty meeting and trusting new people. His trial into a new home will last up to a month and his placement includes 3 in-person or virtual training sessions with a professional trainer if needed. \n\nZevs is a very sweet boy who does struggle when meeting new people. Slow introductions to people are best for him. Because of this, he requires a home that doesn't have a lot of people coming or going. With the people who he trusts, Zevs is a big sweetheart who is super affectionate and sweet. Due to his strong love for familiar people and home, Zevs has a tendency to take on the job of guarding. Careful attention to making roles and responsibilities clear will be essential. Zevs adopters will work with his trainer to learn his recipe for success. Zevs is a goofy guy who enjoys throwing his toys in the air, running around in circles and digging holes in the yard. When inside, Zevs is a cuddle bug and a couch potato who loves to Netflix and chill. \n\nZevs is food motivated and this makes it easy to bond and work with him. He requires an experienced owner who will continue to provide him with structure and training to allow Zevs to grow and thrive. \n\nZevs has successfully stayed with another dog previously and has been able to play and be with other dogs once he has been introduced properly to them. He can be rude and over the top, so tolerant dogs would be best along with people that are willing to teach him boundaries and how to play appropriately with others. \n\nYou can apply at www.sitwithme.com/zevs\n",

He is part of a bonded pair with his brother North and they will be adopted together\nIf you would like to meet Weston and his brother, contact us to make an appointment to come visit him during our adoption hours: Monday evenings between 6 and 8pm, or Saturdays from 11am until 4pm.\n<p> Dogs over 6 months are tested for heartworms and treated if positive. Any other health problems are treated. Dogs are kept on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. All dogs are already spayed or neutered, de-wormed, current on vaccinations, and microchipped. They typically share a kennel with another dog (depending on size and temperament), and usually go outside several times a day with a play group. </p>\n<p>Our dog adoption fee is $125-175.

She is kind of goofy, very playful, easygoing and a very happy girl. She gets along with other dogs, likes to play with toys -- she'll chase them and bring them back until she decides there might be more interesting things to investigate. She LOVES treats and is a smart girl, so training her should be easy. She walks well on a leash really enjoys hanging out with people.\n\nReece is not so good with other dogs. She has a high prey drive for other animals -- a serious prey drive. She needs to be the only pet in the home, and cannot go to dog parks. She needs an experienced owner who will work with her to ensure she is safe while walking. She cannot be let off leash if she is not in an enclosed area with no other animals. This is a must.\n\nTo see more photos and some videos of Reece, go here.",

            "description": "Lorelei is about a year old, 40 pound bull dog mix. Our Lorelei has had a roller coaster of the last few months. As part of a massive 11-dog transport from Georgia, she was the actual Momma to Baby Rory and the \"acting Momma\" to every other puppy on the transport. Despite having little to no milk left, every pup attempted to nurse from her and she patiently and dedicatedly let them. Lorelei was found to be heartworm positive. Upon being given her first routine dose of monthly medication for heartworm preventative, her body revolted. The dying microfilaria caused her to have seizures! It's a rare response... with the dedication and devotion of her foster and the commitment of our vets to figuring her out, we have now discovered Lorelei just needs a five day course of steroids coinciding with her monthly Med and she does perfectly fine taking them now! She's had skin issues we addressed, Urinary issues, vaginitis... it seemed at every turn was another hurdle for our girl.\n\nIn between all these medical marvels, Lorelei learned about the good life. She vacationed in the mountains with her foster family. She went to breweries and had weekend outings with her foster momma. She met lots of folks who instantly fell in love with her. She learned to play, to enjoy the freedom of a yard and the joy of a long walk. She learned to love by being loved.\n\nIt's time. Lorelei is ready for her forever home. She's doing wonderfully going through her heartworm treatment via the slow kill method with the steroid addition monthly. She has lived in a home with three small dogs and done phenomenally well. She's besties with the little chi-mix girl in her her foster home.\n\nIn her forever, Lorelei would like soemone to continue to broaden her horizons with experiences. She also needs a sweet, playful pup to be her friend.\n\nLorelei is spayed up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Adoption donation is $250.\n\nIf you would like to meet any of our dogs please fill out an adoption application on www.maxxandme.org\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

With a bit of patience and some help from treats, he will quickly come out of his shell. He is part of a bonded pair with his brother Weston and they will be adopted together. If you would like to meet North and his brother, contact us to make an appointment to come visit him during our adoption hours: Monday evenings between 6 and 8pm, or Saturdays from 11am until 4pm.\n<p>Dogs over 6 months are tested for heartworms and treated if positive. Any other health problems are treated. Dogs are kept on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. All dogs are already spayed or neutered, de-wormed, current on vaccinations, and microchipped. They typically share a kennel with another dog (depending on size and temperament), and usually go outside several times a day with a play group. </p>\n<p>Our dog adoption fee is $125-175. ($175 for small breeds)</p>\n<p>Weight = (if puppy, estimated weight when adult)</p>\nEst. Age=",

I was born with a spinal deformity and I am unable to know when I have to \u201cgo.\u201d While here at the rescue, the community came together and raised funds for me to have a spinal surgery to see if it could be fixed, but it could not. I am incontinent for life.  Searching for a dedicated human that doesn\u2019t mind diapering me when inside, which I tolerate well.  I even do a cute dance while being diapered.  My ideal life is to run outside most of the time and when inside, wearing my diaper.  I have a loving nature for my owners, but am fairly unsocialized so slow to warm up to strangers. I am spayed, microchipped and up-to-date on vaccines.  Are you my human?  If you are interested please complete and submit an application at gratefulrescue.org",

Searching for a human who is more of a stay-at-home human.  An introvert without much company is ideal. Some call me unsocialized, I say protective. Although I have never bitten anyone, people fear me when I use my powerful voice to yell at people. I don\u2019t particularly like leashed walks, because prior adopters complain I pull too hard and bark at strangers.  I need a fenced in yard to run and play but also need to be allowed inside as a house dog because I also love being on a couch or lying at my human\u2019s feet. I do get along with other dogs, but I am also content with my human as my playmate. I am housebroken, neutered, microchipped and up-to-date on my vaccines. Are you my human?

Anyone who has met her can tell you, she has the brightest spirit in the world and will instantly steal your heart!\n\nZora:\n- Loves people\n- Loves dogs\n- Loves playing outside \n- Loves treats and takes them so gently\n- Has gotten along with some cats and has reacted toward others \u2014 She likely would just need a slow introduction\n\nWe pulled Zora from the county shelter in honor of National Dog Day. The volunteers there were in love with her and were desperate to get her out. \n\nWhen we picked Zora up, she couldn\u2019t walk well, due to emaciation and weakness. She collapsed in the parking lot, had to be carried into the house, and had to be held up while eating. Now, our girl is so much stronger! She absolutely loves to play at the dog park and take naps with her human! If you're looking for a dog to make you laugh, play with, and then nap with, Zora is your girl! \n\nZora has some special needs, so please read that portion of her profile, too. Zora will be spayed before being adopted out.",

Zora will never regain full function of her back legs, but she walks and runs well still! Check out the video in her bio to see. She also has minor incontinence issues. She'll likely have some accidents in the house, but it is very manageable and she goes outside the majority of the time.",

            "description": "Beefcake truly lives up to his name! This 80 pound goofy dog is affectionate, sweet, friendly, and playful! He is a BIG boy and he is very strong on leash and will need a refresher course on basic obedience but he does know how to sit, give paw, and to lay down! He is good with other dogs but definitely needs another big strong buddy to play with. He is even good with cats! We think he would be best with children 10 or 12 years and older just due to his sheer size! His is going to need someone to help him finish up some basic obedience training to help him be the best dog he can be! He would benefit from some structure and rules as well. His adoption fee is $295 and that includes he is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative. If you are interested in adopting any of our animals please fill out an application on our website www.lastchanceranch.org Primary Color: Brindle Age: 5yrs 3mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

George lost his sight, but you'd never know it! There are three things that make George ecstatically happy~ belly rubs, children, and toys. When you rub his side, he will flop over and expose his entire belly so you don't miss one single bit of it. When he hears the giggling of children, he will run to find that small person and woof for attention. When George comes across a toy, he will zoomy in a circle with his ear down to the ground so he doesn't lose track of where he is. He is extremely resourceful, and his other senses work very well.\n\nGeorge has been through a lot in his life, and we made a promise to him that we would find him the perfect family. That family will preferably have a one story house so he doesn't fall down stairs; a ton of patience to help guide him around in his new abode; a fenced in yard or other safe space to play with his ball; and an available hand for endless belly rubs; and dog savvy children. In his perfect home there are no other animals because he deserves to be the one and only and get all the attention.\n\nGeorge is house broken and crate trained and will come when he's called and knows 'sit.' He'd prefer to actually sit in your lap or lean into your legs, and we think that is pretty adorable. After all, a relaxed sit is still a sit in our book.\n\nAre you the happily ever after for George?\n\nGeorge is up-to-date, neutered, and blind. His adoption fee is $300.",

Kamper is house trained and knows all his manners. Although, a senior boy, he still loves to play and chew on his toys. This boy absolutely adores people, giving kisses and snuggling, and would make a perfect family dog. Kamper would do best as the only dog in the home but is not dog reactive when passing by other dogs in the kennel. Kamper is 11 years old and weighs 42 lbs. He has very quickly become a volunteer favorite. Make an appointment to meet him and you'll love him too. Email adoptions@satchelslastresort.org, call 941-924-5070 or submit the adoption application found on our website (no commitment).",

Are you part of it? I hope someone reading this is.\n\nI am still a little insecure about meeting new people and may duck my head or avoid contact initially. If you will give me some space, I will come around and invite you to pet my wiggling body and wagging tail. \n\nI am a full grown, but still young, energetic pocket pit (35#). I am totally housebroken, settle nicely in a crate, and am learning basic house manners (apparently stealing dog treats off the counter is NOT ok) and how walk politely on a leash. \n\nI have lots of energy, am faster than a speeding tennis ball, can leap sectional sofas in a single bound (particularly if the words \"walk, \"outside , or \"hungry are mentioned). A house with a yard is NOT needed, because I can jump about 3' from a standstill and clear a solid wood 6' fence from a trot if there's proper motivation on the other side (proper motivation = squirrel). So, I will need someone who doesn't plan to leave me in a yard and is up for a couple of good walks a day. I'm getting better with each walk about my lash manners and enjoy my neighborhood walks. I would probably love to get involved in some kind of dog sport, I'm little, fast, smart and love pleasing my person. \n\nI am also an expert cuddler that likes to curl up on the sofa at the end of the day or if you get up really early and want company while you drink your coffee and watch the news.\nIn my current foster, I have 2 BIG dog friends, 1 male, and 1 female. I was nervous about meeting them at first, but my foster took it slow and supervised our interactions, allowing me to go at my own pace until I understood dogs could be my friends. My foster recommends if you have a dog you do the same type of slow, monitored introductions. My foster is not sure I'd be good with cats, because I might confuse them with squirrels, especially if they run from me. \n\nIf I sound like your kind of girl, fill out an application and arrange and they'll connect you with my foster!",

Consider one of our Well Seasoned Seniors who are truly wonderful and have so much to offer. Need help finding the best fit? We'll help with that too. Please fill out an application and let's get you all matched up with a loving new \"furever' companion and friend. You'll find the application on the \"Available Dogs\" page.\n\nNOTE:\n\nAdoptions to Central/South Texas residents only\n\nStandard Adoption Fee Adult Dog: $250 ea. Puppy Adoption Fee: $300 ea. Reduced rates for Seniors dogs (10 and up). Reduced rates for pairs (when adopted together). All adoption fees are subject to sales tax per the State of Texas. DDRTX only adopts in Central/South Texas.\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\nRex is a sweet, older gentleman. The vet guessed him to be about 12 years old and he came in very thin. We are working on getting some weight on him.\n\nHe takes a few days to get used to someone, but then once accepting them, has no problem coming and nudging you hand to pet him, and will keep nudging until he satisfied. He's very gentle and quiet, haven't heard him bark yet.\n\nHe's happiest curled up in a soft blanket or dog bed. He's learning the doggie door, but also alerts you when he needs to go out by standing by the door.\n\nStill has a little spunk in him and will \"dance\" around wanting your attention. Perfect for someone who is home often and wants a companion.\n\nRex is ready for adoption. He will need to be on a kidney diet the rest of his life to keep his kidney healthy. If you have questions about that, just ask. It is an a prescription food you can get from your vet or maybe even Chewy.\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won't permit having a dog? How about being a sponsor or making a donation. Every one of our dachshunds receives excellent medical care along with day to day food, love and housing. Being non-profit, we rely on generous individuals like yourselves to help save these fur babies. You can do this specifically for one dog with the sponsor button on their webpage or a general donation on our \"How To Help\" page. Easy and quick through Pay Pal or your debit/credit card. You generosity is sincerely appreciated by all and is tax deductable. Need other ideas? You'll find tons of them on the How to Help tab. All contributions are tax deductable.\n\nDiamond Dachshund Rescue of Texas is a non-profit 501(c)(3) volunteer organization with focus on rescue and adoption of pure breed Dachshunds. All dogs are fully vetted and housed on private property. Meetings are scheduled upon adoption approval. Thank you for your continued support to the rescue and shelter communities!\nOpt to Adopt!",

            "description": "Kangaroo is ready to bounce right into your life! We think this beauty is possibly a Lab and Terrier mix and around 2 years old. Kangaroo is a sweet and friendly girl that has settled in quickly to her foster home. She came to Labs and More with her one pup and now she is ready to move on from motherhood in favor of a forever home to call her very own. She is currently being treated for a medical condition and won't be ready to meet any families until later on in the year. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Kangaroo, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! If you have adopted from us before or are already approved with a coach, reach out to your coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

She has great manners and does well only chewing on her toys, is potty trained, crate trained, and knows lots of commands! (sit, shake, down, roll over) Shelby loves to snuggle and hang out on the couch about as much as she likes being active. She's a great blend of energetic and cuddly!\n\nShelby does well with other dogs, but can be a bit overzealous in wanting to play with her kitty friends. She has lived in a foster home with older children and has done well with them. She can need some time warming up to new men, but give her a little time and space and she's a friend in no time!\n\nShelby is vaccinated, spayed, microchipped, heartworm negative and her adoption fee is $200. Need a snuggly, loving pup in your life? Shelby is ready to bring you all kinds of joy! Apply to adopt Shelby by completing an application on our website! http://mhrindy.org/adoption-inquiry/***Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.***",

            "description": "*Due to state laws regarding out of state adoptions, we cannot adopt to families in Massachusetts or Rhode Island.*\n\nGlen Coco is a special needs dog looking for a rather specific type of family. Our ultiamate goal is to match him with a foerver family. Please read his description in full prior to inquiring about him.\n\nHe was rescued from a dire situation - he was kept on a chain attached to a tree with no food, water, or shelter. Of course, this had adverse effects on his behavior. When the owner of the property approached him to turn him into animal control, he bit her. He was sent to death row for aggression. I met Glen during a routine visit to see what dogs our animal control had in custody. I met and spent time with Glen and determined that he has too much good in him to be euthanized. He has been in my home with my family for about 4 weeks. He plays great with my dogs and doesn't bother my cats. He does have issues with food guarding and has to be fed in his own crate. He loves to get pets and cuddle on the couch. He is leash trained, crate trained, and doing well with house training. The only problem he has is with discipline. When he has an accident or is told to get off the couch, go to his crate, or go outside when he doesn't want to.. he nips. He doesn't attack, he doesn't break the skin. It's more of a warning bite than anything, but is something that will be an issue for his adoptive family. It isn't his fault that he reacts this way. He was abused and neglected and most likely never taught anything with compassion and understanding. He really is a sweet dog who deserves a second chance at life. \n\nListed breed is an educated guess made by our veterinarian and is NOT a guarantee - this also means we have no way of knowing what a puppy's adult size will be.\n\nThis dog is currently being fostered in Mississippi and will be transported via Barton's Barkers transport services upon adoption. Their adoption fee is $450 and includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, a nose to tail vet check, microchip and transport costs. Second Chances lists dogs as being available in White River Junction, VT because we transport our dogs to the area every 3rd week after they have been adopted. All of our local shelters have a high euthanasia rate due to overpopulation so we created our rescue group to primarily adopt to the northern states to help keep as many dogs as we can from entering our kill shelters.",

            "description": "Adoption fee: $175\n\nPhysical appearance: Hickson is estimated to be about 10 years old. He is black and tan and cropped and docked. At some point before arriving in rescue he was debarked, so when he tries to bark, it sounds more like a raspy cough.\n\nPersonality: Despite Hickon's age, he will run and play with the best of them. He is generally calm and well behaved, but he'll also have some spurts of energy and play with his foster sister. He needs to be watched when playing because sometimes his foster says he becomes \"obsessed\" with his foster sister and he needs to be separated to calm down. and not bug her to death. However, he also has some days where he totally ignores her. His preferred method of play is to start with a stalk, which then turns into pure goofiness.\n\nWhy hes in rescue: Hickson wandered up to the home of a good Samaritan who tried to find his home. After a wild goose chase, his owners were found through the microchip, and they said they did not want him anymore. The good Samaritan thought she found him a home who ended up dumping him in the shelter when they found out he had heartworms.\n\nManners and training: Hickson knows how to sit, laydown, and will come when called. he walks pretty well on a leash and when he does try to pull responds well to a correction. He does well with people, rides well in the car, and is okay in a crate. He is potty trained but is showing some minor signs of separation anxiety. He does well with other dogs but will not be adopted to a home with another male. he will need a slow introduction to any other dogs in the home and be monitored closely so he doesn't get too obnoxious and learns boundaries. We do not know how he is with cats. Since he is very clumsy when he plays, we do not recommend a home with smaller children as he will likely knock them over.\n\nVetting: All of our dogs are brought up to date on rabies, Bordetella, and combo, negative for intestinal parasites and heartworms, neutered and microchipped before adoption. Hickson tested positive for heartworms when arriving at rescue and is currently undergoing treatment. He will complete treatment before being adopted out.",

            "description": "We are currently closed to the public and will only be responding to pet inquiries accompanying an online adoption application. Once animals are posted, we immediately begin receiving applications. With one volunteer available to review all applications, we appreciate your patience as you wait for an email response. Adoption appointments are scheduled in the order that approved applications are received. You can find our adoption procedures and online application at warmhearts.org/adopt.\n\nPrincess was abandoned on our property, so we don't have any background information. It is always very sad to see a senior dog displaced from/by their family, because their odds aren't great that they'll be chosen for adoption. Princess is a laid back girl who--as you can guess--is quite confused by being here. She truly needs to get back into a home where she can live out her life in dignity. Princess's estimated DOB is 8/1/2013. She weighs about 76 pounds and could use trimming down some.\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

            "description": "I came to rescue when I was a pup. I had been hit by a car and had a horrendously broken leg. A nice person sponsored my surgery and a nice foster home took me in so that I could recover. My leg healed and I was adopted. Sadly, the family could no longer keep me and I was returned through no fault of my own. I am back in rescue and ready for find my FOREVER family! I am such a good boy! I get along great with other dogs and I LOVE LOVE LOVE kids! I adore them! I've never met a stranger. I love everyone! I am the PERFECT family dog!!! However because of my size and energy, I need to be in a home with older children. I wouldn't want to be excited and accidently knock over a small child. I would feel so bad if I accidently hurt one. I am housebroken, and listen well to instructions. I really want to please. Due to my past injury, I favor one of my hind legs a little, but it doesn't slow me down a bit. I love to play, and I'm a great walking/hiking partner. I LOVE playing with other dogs and I'm super affectionate with people. I am so good natured! I'm happy and smiley all day! Fill out an adoption application to meet me! Learn more about me and fill out an online adoption application on the From the Heart Rescue website at: www.fthar.org.\n\nMy requested adoption donation includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations and medical care to date, microchip implantation and registration, collar, leash, ID tag, health check-up and one month of free pet health insurance (some restrictions may apply).\n\nIf Im not exactly what you want, please visit my other friends in rescue at From The Heart Rescue on our website at www.fthar.org.",

            "description": "Meet Ryder.............a true survivor!  He's looking for a dedicated and qualified person who can walk through his healing process with him. \n \nRyder is a handsome eight-year-old male Pointer/Pit mix who has endured some big-time neglect.  However, he also has proven to be on the road to a very happy/healthy recovery. He is such an awesome dog, and given everything he's been through any dog lover would want to get him out of the shelter ASAP.  Even the staff realize it\u2019s just not the right environment for Ryder.\n\nRyder continues to recover physically.  He has demonstrated a few situational behavior issues when around strangers. As we advocate for his needs, we are looking for a very particular forever or foster home so he can prosper into new life adventures.\n\nRyder was found back in April literally boarded up with another dog inside an abandoned car.  He was absolutely emaciated and covered head to toe with infected sores and bite wounds from the other dog.  Even his poor eyes and the bottoms of his feet were infected.  The dogs had both been alone in the car, starving, for who knows how long.  Ryder was only about 39 pounds when he was found.  A month later, Ryder was up to a healthy 65 pounds.  He has been on various medications and treatments over the several months as a team of dedicated people try to get his skin, eyes and paws back to normal.  This guy has made HUGE progress and looks like a totally different dog. He's probably going to be recovering, on meds, and needing semi-regular check-ups for a while.  He last vet visit was in August. They started him on a new course of antibiotics, eye meds, and skin meds.  He has been growly with male veterinarians when he's first met them, although he was fine with them after just a few minutes.\n\nBehaviorally, Ryder is your typical smart, super-goofball Pitbull.  He\u2019s very intelligent and eager, lots of healthy energy for his age, good on-leash, totally housebroken, very affectionate and responsive with people he knows.  He has done well with most of the other dogs he's met.  Ryder is generally more comfortable with women.  He has been kennel-reactive to strangers walking by, both male and female.  Mostly just barking, but sometimes he will lunge at the gate if the stranger (with a backpack, hat and/or sunglasses) lingers.  Since he was a homeless person's dog for the majority of his life, his protectiveness is quite understandable.  His triggers will be important to respect as Ryder learns to increase his ability to trust. Potential!  Potential!  Potential!  He\u2019s almost there!\nIn the right foster or forever home, Ryder is going to do amazingly well!   He\u2019s such a great dog when he's in a comfortable setting.  Clearly, he has been through many difficult situations.  He has not given up!  \n\nIf interested, please send a brief description of what you can offer Ryder. ellen.second.chance@gmail.com\n",

            "description": "Please meet Derby boy! Derby is a 5-year-old, neutered male with a sweet gentle spirit and to meet him is to fall in love. He is playful and energetic as well as obedient and knows his basic commands. He likes walks and car rides and most of all playing and playing - then downtime with humans. Exercise is a very important part of Derby being successful in a home.\n\nDerby needs to be the one and only dog in your life, but he will fill your heart with so much joy that he will be enough! He likes kids but would do better with older children (over the age of 12) as he appreciates their \"playstyle\". He doesn't quite understand younger children.\n\nHe needs a family that will continue with his training and understands that he will do better with some boundaries in place. He LOVES people and is eager to learn and please, and is a quick study. We continue to work on training for Derby and are working on crate training while he waits for his new family. A consultation with our trainer will be available for Derby's new family. Most of all, Derby wants nothing more than to find a family to love.\n\nIf you would like to meet Derby please complete the application at www.azpawsandclaws.com and we can arrange a meet and greet. Thank you for rescuing.'",

            "description": "Hi there, I\u2019m Maya and I think I could be the girl of your dreams. \n \nI\u2019m a sassy 66 lb. gorgeous, cashmere soft, 8-year-old English Bulldog and I\u2019ve been deaf since birth \u2013 don't worry about communicating though, I\u2019ll let you know when I want something.  My foster family has also worked with me to develop a series of signs and taps on my body that help us \u201ctalk\u201d with each other and they seem to be working well and I\u2019m improving every day.  In addition I have this amazing loving gaze and can communicate with my expressions and will put my full bear claw paw in your lap when I want you to pet me. \n \nI am at my happiest sitting in the backyard, strolling the neighborhood or going for a car ride.  I love walking \u2013 I\u2019m slower than I used to be and have some arthritis in my back legs but that doesn\u2019t stop me. Oh, and I do have to occasionally stop and have a roll around in the grass, a little nap or drink from one of those cool outdoor sprinklers.  I love to get my whole head in there and soak it up.  My foster family says it\u2019s like a good face pressure wash for me.  I am also obsessed with car rides. I am happy to go anywhere you are willing to drive me and I am super well behaved in the car.  I either snooze away happily or gaze out the window at the great big world.  When my foster family dangles the car keys I make a dash for the backdoor.  \n \nWhen I was rescued, I was really struggling with an undiagnosed illness but through amazing doctors and the good folks at CEBR we found out that I have Cushing's disease. I\u2019m on medication for it which I\u2019ll need to take for the rest of my life but the good news is that it\u2019s doing its job and my Cushing's is under control. Check out my gorgeous fluffy white coat. My foster family and my doctors are still trying to figure out one last thing that I\u2019m dealing with but we think we are going to figure it out soon.  Because of this I\u2019m still currently wearing a diaper most of the day but stay tuned for exciting updates. \n \nI love treats \u2013 I can be a little snappy as I\u2019m very eager to eat them but I\u2019ve been working with my foster family on taking them gently and am making real progress. I am also not keen on having my face cleaned and am sensitive about my overall bulldog grooming routine but I am becoming more open as I learn that the good treats get offered when I allow this to happen (I am very food motivated). As a bonus, I do love having my tail pocket cleaned.  \n \nWhen I became ill, I started to have separation anxiety probably because I was just feeling so icky all of the time and needed humans near to make me feel safe.  As I\u2019ve gotten better my foster family has been working with me on this but I would find it comforting to live in a home where people might be around more.  If you\u2019re asking, I\u2019d also like to have a home with fewer stairs as I struggle a little going up and down, especially when I\u2019m tired. To be clear, I can do stairs pretty darn well but I make my Foster Dad carry me upstairs at bedtime \u2013 he's a sucker! \n \nAre you my forever family?  Please send me a note. I\u2019d love to meet you.  \n \nLove Maya \n\nIf you would like to donate to Maya's care, please go to our website at http://shopcebr.com/products/donation.\n\n\nHOW TO QUALIFY FOR A CEBR BULLY To determine if you qualify to adopt one of our adorable bullies start by viewing our Adoption Area Map.

When we first got him from ACS, he was weak and had a hard time getting around, but once we got him healthy again, we were in for a surprise. His age and his grey face may say he's old, but he definitely doesn't act like it. He has TONS of energy and is looking for an active family. He loves his little foster sister (a chihuahua-ish dogs) but can be selective with other dogs, so a meet and greet with other dogs is a must. Once he has chosen you to be his family, be prepared to laugh and smile with this goofy old man.",

            "description": "Asha is a true survivor in every way. She was born in a filthy and horrible Pennsylvania puppy mill. When she did not qualify medically for a health certificate to be sold because of a severe heart murmur at just 8 weeks old, the puppy mill operator held on to her for another couple of months to see if she would grow out of it and considered using her for breeding purposes. He ultimately decided to release her to Finding Shelter and she was diagnosed with a serious heart condition called sub aortic stenosis. Asha\u2019s litter was severely under socialized but with the help of her foster family, she has made progress meeting strangers. Asha needs a very special and experienced home who can handle her progressing heart condition (she takes daily medications and will need them for the remainder of her life) and be patient with her as she is nervous meeting new people. Asha loves toys, she loves to cuddle on the couch and would like to be high energy but her activity needs to be controlled because of her heart. She would do well as an only dog so she wouldn\u2019t try to engage in high activity play. Asha is a wonderful girl with so much love to give and is extremely smart. She just needs to find her perfect match!\n\n*All dogs will go through a transition period after finding a new home and may need a \u201crefresher course\u201d in house-breaking.\nShare this pet\t",

            "description": "Meet Thor!\nThor is a 6 year old German Shepherd rescued from the shelter in June, and quickly won the hearts of his foster family! When he was rescued, it was clear that he had some issues with his hind legs. After consultations with a vet, neurology specialist, orthopedic surgeon, it was determined that he did not need surgery, but that he would benefit from physical therapy. He has already had a couple of sessions and the exercises seem to be helping his back legs get stronger. His foster family reports that his demeanor has changed significantly since they first received him. When he first arrived, he was not feeling his best \u2013 he had an upset stomach, and he was on crate rest due to his leg injuries. Now with some pain management, and alot of TLC, his personality is shining! He is affectionate, loyal, playful, and very smart. Every morning he loves to get spoiled with a full rub down. He is quite food motivated, which has made training very easy! He loves to play fetch, and will often bring you a toy to ask you to play. He loves going on walks (not too long, as his legs will tire), but perhaps his favorite thing to do is go on car rides! He has a very funny quirk where he spins and spins in circles, especially when he is excited. He sleeps in his crate and he is fully potty trained.\n\nBecause of Thor\u2019s hind legs, he will need to be placed in a home where there is carpet or non-slick surfaces, as it is difficult for him to walk on hardwood floors without slipping and potentially injuring himself. He also is not able to climb stairs (a few steps he can handle, and he has no problem jumping in the car!). We would like to place Thor in an experienced adult home or one without small children. \n\nApply at angelsfurryfriends.org/adoption-application/",

            "description": "Please meet Boswer! He is a 15-month-old, 64-pound, neutered Boxer, who is likely part bulldog. Bowser is very sweet and has a LOT of energy. He is quite strong and will need an owner who has Boxer or bully breed experience. Bowser has spent the last couple of months with one of our trainers and has done quite well. It will be important that his new human(s) continue working with him so that he can become the best version of himself possible. Training should be pretty easy as Bowser is very food motivated. \n\nSpeaking of food, it seems Bowser was without food for some time as he's very uncomfortable with anyone near him while he's eating from a bowl. His trainer has made great strides at improving his trust, but this is a work in progress and his new home will need to follow the protocol to help him continue that progress. Please note that he\u2019s totally fine when taking treats or having treats tossed to him.\n\nBowser likes to play with toys and is perfectly happy entertaining himself while his people are busy doing other things around the home. He also enjoys a nice game of tug, but be ready\u2026this boy is strong! Bowser also plays very rough and has not been able to learn how to appropriately play respectfully with other dogs, so he will need to be the only dog in his forever home. And due to his strength and rough play, his ideal home will be one without any kids around; and also, no cats for Bowser.\n\nBowser was found as a stray, so we don\u2019t know anything about his background, but it seems clear he\u2019s not had a lot of interaction or exposure to the outside world. His family will need to introduce him to new things and experiences slowly and be very patient with him so that he can gain confidence and learn to trust.\n\nBowser is going to make a great \u201chang around\u201d kind of dog. When he\u2019s calm, he\u2019s very sweet and will enjoy simply being with his people. We are confident that with patience, and clear and consistent guidance, Bowser is going to blossom into a wonderful pup. If you are interested in welcoming this handsome guy into your heart and home, please let us know by submitting an adoption application - https://www.mustluvboxersrescue.com/adopt.",

            "description": "Hi my name is Shamu, but they lovingly refer to me as Moo Moo! My heart is huge and I love everyone I meet! I will do great with a loving family who has time to play with me in a fenced in backyard and take me on lots of walks! I am a 1.5 year old English Bull Dog/American Bull Dog mix who currently weighs 80 lbs. I'm on a bit of a diet at the moment. Just a reminder, I am still a puppy (just an extra large one) who will need training and understanding. I do sometimes chew on things I'm not supposed to when I'm left alone and not safely in a crate, but that's all part of having a puppy. \n\nApplicants who are interested in adopting Moo Moo, will need to demonstrate patience and understanding. Once the initial screening takes place - via an adoption application, we will set up an initial meet and greet. From there, we will require you to take Moo Moo to multiple weekend training sessions (in Apopka at Natural Instinct Dog Training) while he still resides at our Sanctuary, upon completion of training, we will decide (with you), if Moo Moo is the right fit for you. \n\nWhoever we deem fit to care for this sweet boy, will have his everlasting affection, he couldn't be a more wonderful being!\n\nMy adoption fee is $500 and that includes my shots, neuter, microchip and training at Natural Instinct Dog Training (prior to adoption)!",

Email his caretaker at kdupuy@cox.net to inquire about adopting or for more information.\n\nInformation from caretaker:\nOdin is a big boy with a big personality. A 3 year old 70lb American Staffordshire Terrier, this big bold goober is loyal to a fault and guaranteed to make you laugh. Unfortunately, he is not the best match for his current situation and would love a place to finish growing into his best self. He's looking for a new owner with a less crowded lifestyle to take and lead him into the next part of his life and give all his love to. He has already had a lot of training with plenty of room to grow. Crate trained with decent recall depending on his environment, he walks well on a leash, knows all the basics, eager to please and ready to play at a moment's notice. He's happy to spend the day on the couch with his favorite humans, however this muscleman needs his daily exercise. Sometimes personal space is foreign to him and he is not aware of his size as he snuggles up to get close to his favorite people. He just wants you to touch him and if you find that special spot on his chest and neck he'll beg you not to stop. He can be weary of new people around the ones he loves, especially in tight quarters, but warms up quickly when introduced properly. He's just looking for another compassionate and understanding owner that can provide him space he needs to feel secure and enjoy life. As far as other pets go, he does best with female dogs and most male dogs slightly smaller than him, but has had plenty of big male dog friends over his life. He has a long history of going to camp and interacting with other dogs, the majority of which has been positive. He loves to play rough with the ladies and some of the guys too if they are more submissive. Kitties are a no go. He is not suited for dog parks, as he does not stand down to any funny business from unknown dogs trying to be dominant.  All interactions with kids have been positive",

So if you live in Oregon or Washington I would love you to be my furever people. \nMeet Lunchbox JuM LunchBox is a kid's name for a big dog!! Although, if I were say, Batman LunchBox or ScoobyDoo LunchBox I would be ok with that, but just LUNCHBOX??? not so sure However, that is my name and it denotes some of my personal characteristics, I am SQUARE like a lunchbox :) I am filled with lots of good things and you may have to wait a little while to get to the gooey center of the lunch- cause I am a little shy to start out... So I am about 1.5 yrs old, saved on the border of TX and Mexico- trying to decide if it was a good idea to make a run for the border or not... for ME it was REALLY good idea, because I was seen by a great rescuer and SAVED!!! So I am a beefy boy, chow mix, and about 45#, I look like a lunchbox ;) but don't let that scare you- I am a sweetheart. I want so much to be loved and have a wonderful home. Children definitely make me nervous so I am best in an adult only home, I am good with other dogs and would be best with another kind of lazy, easy going dog. I am ready for love, hopefully you are too ;) Local adoption fee $200.00",

He doesn't mind doing this while you are at work or working around the house. When you are on the couch he is going to come up for cuddles and affection.\n\nHis leg was amputated in early November so he is not the kind of dog that can run marathons or go for long hikes, he would rather keep you company indoors and watch your favorite show together.\n\nWhile Aries does well with other large breed dogs, small crittes, dogs and puppies with too much energy make him nervous and he would do best in a home without them.",

Gumbo is a Catahoula Cur mix about 8 years old but definitely does not act like it.  She loves to run and play but then she is a total lovebug that wants to be right next to you! Gumbo's name fits her so well because she is spicy when it comes to being friends with other animals.  She needs to be in a household where she is the only animal as she wants to be the only one getting your attention.  Unfortunately due to her snobby behavior to other dogs, she has unjustly been overlooked.  As the only dog, Gumbo is truly an amazing dog.  She is beautiful.  She has those stunning blue eyes that many Catahoula Curs are born with! And yes she does bark with a southern drawl.  If you are interested in adopting Gumbo, please email us at LongJ1003@aol.com and Katybug6067@gmail.com.  Thanks for opting to adopt!",

He was in this loving home since he was a puppy - he is only about 3 to 4 years old.  He is neutered and up to date on all his shots.  We think he is house broken because he will not mess up in his kennel; however, we cannot be positive as some dogs act differently in a home than in a shelter environment.  Ramsey has completely stolen all of our hearts at BARK due to his unfortunate placement at BARK!!! He is good with female dogs but he is an alpha male.  He would due best in a home as the only dog or with a sweet female.  His owner had no cats so it is unknown how he would do around cats.  Ramsey has been around older children over the age of 12 years old and has done fine.  He has never been around young children but due to his size, we think he would do better with older kids. If you are interested in adopting Mr. Ramsey, please email us at LongJ1003@aol.com and Katybug6067@gmail.  We would love to speak to you more about him.",

You can see it in her eyes and on her body that life hasn't been kind to her.\n\nGranny is looking for a family who can provide her a calm home where she can be loved. She was found with a young dog wondering the street. She didn't have a chip and no owner came for her. Unfortunately she was Heartworm positive and received treatment. \n\nGranny would do best with no other dogs or kitties. She would love to just sit by her foster and receive all the love imagineable. \n\nDo you have room in your house and heart to help Granny see life can be full of love? \n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

We think he\u2019s mixed with Cattle Dog and/or Lab.  He is 3 years old and weighs 63 lbs but needs to gain a little more weight. \n\n\u2022 Cooper's had a rough life of neglect and a lack of companionship.  Given his history, he's an amazingly sweet natured dog.  He is timid and shy at first, but he warms up pretty quickly with patience and treats.  He loves to snuggle and give kisses, and he is sure that he\u2019s a lap dog!  He\u2019s a sensitive guy and wants to be with you once he knows you.\n\n\u2022 Cooper needs a special home to help him overcome his lack of socialization. We're looking for someone who has experience as a dog parent,  is dog savvy and patient, and comfortable working with a dog who's been undersocialized.     \n\n\u2022 Cooper will need a home without kids, cats or other dogs. He does get along with other dogs, but he's recently had a couple of altercations with his doggie friends here. At this point, we feel that having another dog in the home would be an additional challenge for him behaviorally, and he'd benefit from being an only pet. In the future, another dog companion may be a possibility.  \n\n\u2022 He needs a house and yard with a secure wooden privacy fence. \n\n\u2022 Cooper's done well here with our male staff members, as well as our female staff.  We think he'll do fine with men as long as they are gentle with him.\n\n \u2022 We'd love to hear from you if you may be interested in fostering Cooper!  The shelter environment is very stressful for him and, although we're doing all we can for him, we would love to find him a foster home. \n\n\u2022 Cooper's very bright. He has a medium to medium-high energy and needs someone who is active and will take him for walks or jogs.  He pulls some on a leash, but he's not difficult to walk.  In the future, once he's bonded to his new person and less fearful, we could imagine him doing well in agility.\n\n\u2022 Unfortunately, Cooper tested positive for heartworms.  Instead of the routine heartworm treatment, we are doing a treatment plan that is easier on a dog who is stressed.  He's been getting 2 doses of Advantage Multi twice a month, thru March 15. Then he'll go down to once a month, and be retested for heartworms in September.   We can fill you in more about his treatment plan if you are interested in fostering or adopting Cooper.  We're covering the costs associated.\n\n\u2022 Cooper has been neutered, vaccinated and microchipped.  He\u2019s a very sweet and loving guy and he\u2019ll be a wonderful companion for the person who gives him a chance.\n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

            "description": "Date of birth:  9/24/2015\n\n11/7/2020:  River is a big handsome Lab/Shepherd mix! He\u2019s 5 years old and weighs 76 lbs, with very long legs.  River is super friendly and loves people. \n\n\u2022 He\u2019s very playful and loves to play with stuffed toys and gallop around the yard with them in his mouth!\n\n\u2022 River does well playing with younger, playful female dogs. We've found that he doesn't do as well with male dogs. If you have an energetic female dog who's looking for a playmate, you could bring your dog to meet River to see if they could be buddies.\n\n\u2022 Rive is super smart! He quickly learned how to open the door on his kennel and the big gate in the yard\u2026 he\u2019s the first to ever do that!  So, this guy will need a locked gate on the fence and supervision in a yard. We expect that he\u2019d easily go over a chain link so a privacy fence would be appropriate.  He\u2019ll also need lots of exercise and mental stimulation to keep him busy and out of trouble! \n\n\u2022 River takes treats very gently and he\u2019s pretty good about not jumping up on people. We think he\u2019d be okay with kids who\u2019ve been around a large dog and are very comfortable with that.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s strong and will need someone who can handle walking a big strong dog. Training would benefit him.\n\n\u2022 River keeps his kennel clean.  He has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms.  \n\n\u2022 He\u2019s a big, fun, happy boy and he\u2019ll be a great companion for someone wanting an extremely clever and playful friend! \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

He is currently in a foster home with another adult dog and they are best pals! His foster momma says he is the sweetest and needs to get adopted soon or they're not going to want to give him up he's that perfect. \n\nHe is house trained- he has had no accidents since going to his foster home. He has no food or toy aggression. He has great manners when playing with the other dog in his home as well. He also knows his basic commands. He isn't a huge fan of the crate but the foster is working on that and he does go in when the door is left open. He has some separation anxiety so a home with another dog would be a plus. He has seen the cats at the foster home and does growl a bit at them but has not acted aggressively towards them. He would be fine in a home with children.\n\nHoot is up to date on all shots, neutered and microchipped. He is current on flea, tick and heartworm prevention. He is available for meet and greets locally.\nHe can also be adopted out of state to approved adopters- a transport fee would apply in addition to his adoption fee. \n\n",

He is definitely going to turn out to be a velcro dog, loving his people! \n\nHe is already crate and potty trained. \n\nHe is very submissive and loving, and does great with other dogs as long as they are not overly pushy.\n\nWe are a rescue run by dog trainers! If you are not interested in or financially able to continue with the training and care we are providing for him please do not inquire. We strive to find the best home for our dogs that will give them the time, mental stimulation, physical exercise, and effort that they deserve.\n\nFollow his progress/updates on IG through @shadesofbludogtraining @woofgangrehab and @phantomk9_",

            "description": "Pixie and Zach are a bonded pair of cocker spaniels, approximately 12 yrs old.  Pixie (female) was born approximately 2008, and Zach (male) was born approximately 2009.  Pixie is at least partially blind and relies on Zach to help her navigate. Zach is a true gentleman and frequently checks on his friend to make sure she's ok.  They are both wonderfully sweet and are learning what the good life is all about!  They both had dental cleanings in September, and have had bloodwork done at our vet's office.  Adopting these 2 seniors is sure to bring just as much joy to your life as you bring to theirs!\n\nPlease note: Due to COVID-19, our visitation policy has changed. LIFE House is currently open by appointment only to individuals with approved applications. Please download the adoption from our website (www.lifehouse4animals.org, under the 'Adopt' section) and email it directly to the adoption counselor at amyc0405@yahoo.com. If your application is approved, the adoption counselor will facilitate an appointment for you to meet this animal.\n\nWe are located at 14 Fido Ct., Frankfort KY 40601.\n\nIf you have questions about this animal, please contact the adoption counselor directly at amyc0405@yahoo.com. We are staffed by volunteers and are typically unable to complete the adoption process on the same day that applications are submitted. Please understand that it can sometimes take 2-4 days to process an application.",

            "description": "Tara is the sweetest, 12 month old, almost 45 lbs, bouncy, playful, goofy, smart, eager to please puppy. It can take her a bit to warm up to some new folks, yet others, she likes immediately. She has had such a crazy life so far, yet she is lovely and affectionate. She was dumped by her first family, as they had no time for her and did not train her, so another family got her off craigslist, where the 14 year old, sadistic daughter, beat this dog to try to make her into a guard/attack dog. (She also cut the tails off 2 kittens, thinking they were cuter with no tails!) A local shelter ended up with her (and the kittens), where she was crazy, being in a kennel all day long, so she did not show well, when folks came to meet her. Tara was originally posted as a coonhound mix, for the shelter saw her coloring and assumed that is what she is, but she is not a coonhound. She is a herder dog, for sure. She is in with 7 dogs and does fine, but one on one, folks need to be alpha, or she can be bossy and bratty at times, with another dog, but she does enjoy playing with another dog. She needs an experienced home that can get her more training and teach her stuff, for she is so smart and could probably be great at agility or some other cool type of training. She is not hyper, just smart and active and ready to learn. She is okay with some cats as well, but could chase. Great in the car, and crate trained and housebroken. A fenced yard is a must, and no young kids, for she might be too rough. A must meet, for she is so adorable in person, with all of her speckles and cute half mask. Please, open your hearts and home to this sweet pup - you will be so glad you did.  CRPUPS@PTD.NET to contact us for any reason. (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there might be something wrong with your email! WE DO NOT TEXT) \nLovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. \n\nOur dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! \n\nLovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)\n\nOur dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.  (We do not tend to place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE feel would be the best homes for our dogs.)  \nPlease, come adopt one of our Lovable Mutts - you will be so glad you did!\n\n(IF YOU DO NOT GET A REPLY EMAIL WITHIN 24 HOURS, CHECK YOUR SPAM BOX - WE REPLY EVERY FEW HOURS TO EMAILS)",

A fenced yard is a must, and no young kids, for she might be too rough. A must meet, for she is so adorable in person, with all of her speckles and cute half mask. Please, open your hearts and home to this sweet pup - you will be so glad you did.  CRPUPS@PTD.NET to contact us for any reason. (Fostered in PA - We do not text) (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there is clearly something wrong with your email!) Dog's Best Friend Adoption Center utilizes an adoption application and screening process. We require personal and vet references and a home check made prior to adopting one of our dogs. All of our dogs are companion animals that must be kept inside the house with the rest of the family members. All of our dogs are temperament tested, well mannered, and know some basic commands ~ they are worked with daily, as someone is always here with them. All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats. Adoption donations range from $250 to $450, depending on breed, age, size, vetting, and training of the dog (some pure bred and tiny dog fees are higher). This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care. Dog's Best Friend dogs truly make wonderful family pets. Please  email us for an application. (If you email us and do not hear back from us within 24 hours, please try again, as we most likely did not receive your email!) (Also note that many of our dogs are fostered just across the border into PA)",

I love to run, jump, and play, (especially with toys that squeak!) but at the end of the day I just really would love a family who can spend quality time with me (which sometimes means naps, because who doesn't like naps?!).\n\nI know how to Sit, Lay Down, and how to jump in the bathtub for a bath! I do a great job going in and out of my crate nicely, and I can walk on leash with a harness!\n\nI lived with a cat friend for a while but then some guy who also called himself Doctor told me I was allergic to my cat friend! I was devastated. But I've been much less itchy since we stopped hanging out. I dunno what that's about.\n\nI do like hanging out with dog friends occasionally, but I might prefer to be an only dog... I'm a little bit of an attention hog.\n\nI'm up to date on my shots, neutered, and housebroken!\n\nMy foster mom can tell you about my allergy meds, favorite foods and treats so that I stay healthy and happy in your home! My foster mom says any family interested in me better brace themselves for a lifetime of wiggles, love, and tug-o-war!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please text 480-359-7109\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

I'm a happy go lucky kinda boy, and I'm looking for a nice new family who will love me forever and ever!!\n\nI was brought to the shelter after someone found me as a stray.  I'm not sure where my family went, but I sure do miss them!  The vet thinks I'm only about a year old, so I have a lot of life ahead of me!!  I just need someone special to share it with!\n\nA few things you should know about me are that I'm deaf and have some neurological concerns as well.  I don't let that hold me back though!  I still love going for walks and exploring the neighborhood, I also love to play!  I would do best in a home with someone who has experience with large special needs dogs, and who is ready to help teach me all the things a good doggie should know!!\n\nThe people here at the shelter have been working with me on some sign language to teach me how to sit, and I've been doing pretty well!  But I will need more training in a new home.\n\nIf you have room in your heart and house for a big guy like me, please stop by the shelter and spend some time getting to know me!",

She is a total sweetheart who loves to be held, go for walks, play with her toys, or just snuggle next to you.   She\u2019s the ultimate lap dog!  She is not hyper or a barker, but to the contrary...she is a very well behaved young lady.  She appears to be afraid of other dogs (perhaps she had a bad experience and being a small dog doesn\u2019t help), but she gets along great with cats.  Blanca is now waiting for a quiet home to call her own.  Due to her petite size, she prefers a home without any small children.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all our pets have been spayed/neutered and have been given rabies and DA2PP vaccines.\n\nRIGHT CLICK THIS LINK TO OUR ONLINE APPLICATION AND OPEN IN A NEW WINDOW \nhttps://rawhiderescue.org/?page_id=13 \n\n\nTHIS IS THE LINK TO THE APPLICATION WORD DOCUMENT  THAT CAN BE EMAILED TO RAWHIDERESCUE@HOTMAIL.COM:\n http://members.petfinder.com/~NJ235/Forms/RawhideDogApplication.doc\n \n\nOUR HOME PAGE:\n https://www.rawhiderescue.org\n\nTHIS IS THE LINK TO THE APPLICATION WORD DOCUMENT OR PDF THAT CAN BE EMAILED TO RAWHIDERESCUE@HOTMAIL.COM:\n http://members.petfinder.com/~NJ235/Forms/RawhideDogApplication.doc\n https://rawhiderescue.com/RawhideDogApplication.pdf\n\nOUR HOME PAGE:\n https://www.rawhiderescue.org",

            "description": "Freddy is around 4 years old, weighs a bit less than 50 lbs and was rescued from Puerto Rico, so he is a medium sized Sato, known for being extraordinarily loyal and loving dogs. He might not be the best pup to adopt if you have a cat, though.\n\nHis rescuer and foster says: As I went by Tropical Beach I saw a man in a wheelchair in the middle of the road. He was trying to help a dog that was hit by a car. The situation was crazy, no time for anything. I said if you can get him in the car, I'll get him to a vet.  The man and a woman who came rushing up, got him in the car (all this in less than 5 mins). I raced off to the vet clinic.  It was Sunday, but they opened the clinic, checked him out, and got him on pain meds (his pain was horrible). Next day X-rays showed a fractured spinal column and a fractured lower leg/paw.\nSlowly he healed. Slowly began walking. The entire clinic fell in love with him. The vet keeps saying he is THE BEST DOG EVER \"un caballero.\"\nHe will always walk funny, sort of bowlegged.  His front paw sort of doubles up on him sometimes but he corrects it instantly. He loves people! Right now he is just like \"Too much down time, I want to play, sniff, run, sniff, enjoy, sniff. \"\nAll through enormous pain, he never ever tried to bite or growl or anything. He is good with other dogs.  His big thing is to sniff them.\nHE HAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST DOGGY SMILE!!\n\n\nIf they are listed on PetFinder, they have not yet been adopted. If you wish to meet them or find out more about them that is not included in their profile, please fill out our adoption application at http://bit.ly/PSDAdopt and our adoption counselor will contact you as soon as possible.",

She gets along with most dogs but tends to be cautious on first meets. She has her sister Dorothy that plays with her all the time. She also gets along with the other dogs here. She will weigh about 35 pounds when fully grown. She is curious and eager to learn and grow with her new family.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are fully wormed, receive rabies and core vaccinations, microchipped, behavior assessed with other dogs and humans (sorry, no cat testing is done here), spend a minimum of 3 weeks free-ranging within a pack of 30 dogs to grow confidence and trust and may have DNA results. All dogs receive lifetime behavior support and can be returned anytime without a fee. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: You MUST complete an adoption application in order to see or adopt a dog from us. The completed adoption application ensures your 'spot' in order of adoption. Emailing/calling with questions will delay your adoption process.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION --> www.petsreturnhome.org/adoption-application",

A 6yo Hound mix who is excited to find his forever home. \n\nLuke is 60-pounds of energy, love, and curiosity! His curiosity levels to that of a cat, who we have found would not be the best home companion for him. Luke\u2019s enthusiasm to chase the cats is a little too much and so no cats for him. \n\nLuke is a wonderful balance of high energy playtimes and low-key cuddle sessions. He has the most amazing time on walks, sniffing everything there is to be sniffed and being on the lookout for squirrels.\n\nWhen Luke is nervous, he does go to the nearest safe zone like under a table. He does best when you let him be and become comfortable again. Also, when he feels he is being confronted with commotion or too quickly, he does bark to let you know \u201chey, I need my space for a little bit\u201d and then will go to his safe zone for a little bit to relax. This is also why we are recommending there be no kids in his forever home. \n\nLuke has met other dogs and is initially apprehensive, not sure what they are about, and sometimes he vocalizes this. With more introductions though, he does warm up. He might do well having another dog in the house who is patient and will show him the ropes and will need a slow introduction to start. \n\n Luke is looking for an active home that will provide him with the ample daily exercise that he needs and loves. Also, a home with loving and patient humans who are willing to work with him on some of his manners and quirks. Finally, a home with a fenced yard would be amazing and give him the most happiness!\n\n\n\n\nHis adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm/Lyme test, all age-appropriate vaccinations (distemper, rabies, & Bordetella), HW and flea/tick preventative, and microchip implant and registration. \n\nThere is no guarantee of age and breed as a rescue animal's history is unknown. All ages and breeds are best guess.\n\nAdoption fees INCLUDE a mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nDue to post-adoption services provided, it is Pet Haven's policy to only place dogs into homes within a 75-mile radius of the Minneapolis, MN city center.\n\n",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Shadow! I am a little on the shy side at first, but once I get to know you, we will be best friends for life. One of the easiest ways to become my best friend is to offer me lots of treats I am very food motivated. Once we are friends, I will wiggle with happiness and be the most affectionate dog you have ever met. I am also nervous in new environments and take a few minutes to warm up. However, when I am comfortable, I am really playful. I love to find large sticks to run around with or dunk my head in nearby pools. Once I get all my energy out running around, I just want to relax next to you. I prefer more quiet homes, so noises don't interrupt my beauty sleep. As an added bonus, I am good with dogs and cats. So if you are looking for your own Shadow in life, please consider adopting me!",

            "description": "~~~~~\nToby for now- is just that - He needs a better name.... There is another thing that he needs too... A REAL Family!  How do you  love and live with a dog for two and a half to three years and leave him behind??? \nWe don't get it , either!  He loves to hunker down under the covers and loves to do zooms around the house from time to time. He is a lover not a fighter- but this being said, we have NO IDEA what he feels about cats- \nHe'd likely chase one- \nHe appears to have another breed in him as well; not a pure - bred dog, but he is SO cheerful and sweet , you wouldn't care awnyway!  \n\n\n~~~~~\n\n\nDue to Covid-19 concerns, we are not planning any public adoption events. If you are pre approved , we will call to set up an appointment to come and meet the dog and potentially take them home. It is by appointment only- \nDogs will be brought into the outdoor kennel for you to meet and make your decision. MASKS WILL BE MANDATORY to maintain EVERYONE'S safety  NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE !! \nThe puppies and dogs listed will arrive on Saturday, October 24th, 2020 .\n\nhttp://littlerhodyrescue.com/adoption-application/ \n\n*Filling an application does not guarantee you as the adopter. All applicant's references will be called. PLEASE call your veterinarian and references consent to speaking with us ! \nWe cannot process your application otherwise. Failure will put your application in 'Limbo\"  \nWe process applications as they arrive. The first approved applicant will be called and the pup taken off of Petfinder. We do not have the man/ woman power to all all other applicants to advise them. \nIF there s another dog that you are interested in as well, please list at the top of the application and we will enter your application for that pup if the first choice has been adopted. \n\nTHANK YOU !!! You are giving a first rate dog a second chance....By adopting! \n\n***** SADLY , we need to put this in print: THIS IS A RESCUE DOG. We do NOT know their birthday / age.  (unless other wise noted)  \nMore often than not, OUR TEAM  has saved them from euthanasia in Southern shelters. \nWe do not know any more than our Veterinarians offer to us. \n We often have them in kennels, and utilize crate training.  House training status is often NOT KNOWN. \nPrior Health, estimated weight  (as an adult), breed (Including the parents' breed , size or mix)   and some health concerns are  NOT KNOWN unless our veterinarians discover it and offer the information to us.   Again, these are strays and turn ins from all over the country. They do NOT come with labels; nor guarantees. \n\nCharacteristics and disposition can and will evolve with time.\nYOU the adopter are responsible to train and keep up to date on vaccines and preventatives.  \nYOU the adopter are responsible for taking care of this new member of your family. \n *************\n\n****\nOur adoption fees are $ 600. This fee includes the transportation of the pet from one of the organizations that we work with in TX, LA or TN. Before joining us in RI all dogs are: spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, and on de-wormers, flea/tick and heartworm prevention. In addition, all adults (6 months +) are heartworm tested and MUST be negative for both heartworm and microfilaria before transport. \n\nIn addition to the above, all dogs must have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and be deemed healthy per USDA law in order to travel. Once they have been certified they are then transported via USDA transport services only, which is required by law. \n We  sometimes don't understand how bad the situation is for these pups and dogs in southern states.  Many people in the south don't spay or neuter their pets as we do here. Subsequently, there are thousands of beautiful , worthy pups and dogs, kittens and cats  that are dumped, shot, abandoned, brought into shelters, neglected, abused and abandoned.  We step in , tend to their veterinary needs. As you can see above, we never fail to properly spay and neuter. Everything is done with the  caring , capable hands of our veterinarians to get them healthy and ready to place them for adoption. That's when we put the demand for family- friendly pets with the supply ..... \n\nGive a first rate dog a second chance!!!! ADOPT! \n\n\nKeep in mind that we also offer a two week return policy for the return of a healthy dog that includes a full refund. We want to make sure that the adoption is a perfect fit for both you and the dog.\n\nIf you would like more information about adopting please select \"More About Little Rhody Rescue\" where you will also find our online application if you'd like to proceed with the adoption process. Thank you!",

            "description": "L Bonnie is a mature lady that ended up in rescue. She is now 10 years old and has unfortunately lost her family. She does great on a leash (pulls some when she spots a squirrel), loves to go for rides, loves everyone she meets and is a perfectly house mannered girl. Bonnie has gone to work with me at times and we all forget she is there - she just snoozes and hangs out. She has done okay with some dogs in rescue but it doesn't last long so I will be firm she needs to be an only dog - period. Because she is a older I would suggest no small children - she is past babysitting age. If small kids visit your home simply put her up and protect both her and the children from any incident. Sometimes we need to protect the dogs as much as they protect us. Bonnie gives the sweetest little nose kisses and absolutely loves her grown humans. She has met a horse, steer and goats with no interest. I do not know about cats. She also has an ugly scar on her front paw. She had a benign growth removed and was absolutely NOT having the cone. Bonnie really needs a home of her own to finish out her retirement years. She really is the sweetest girl and just tugging at my heartstrings to still be in the kennel. Please apply at www.krrtx.org/forms. \nPlease note all dogs are located in San Antonio, TX. We advertise out of state due to the critical pet overpopulation problem here in the south. We use Our Texas Rescue Connection to transport the dogs to your area. They are all up to date and come with a health certificate. The fee is $170 adoption and $180 transportation = $350. Thank you for considering adopting a southern dog.\n",

            "description": "L Bonnie is a mature lady that ended up in rescue. She is now 10 years old and has unfortunately lost her family. She does great on a leash (pulls some when she spots a squirrel), loves to go for rides, loves everyone she meets and is a perfectly house mannered girl. Bonnie has gone to work with me at times and we all forget she is there - she just snoozes and hangs out. She has done okay with some dogs in rescue but it doesn't last long so I will be firm she needs to be an only dog - period. Because she is a older I would suggest no small children - she is past babysitting age. If small kids visit your home simply put her up and protect both her and the children from any incident. Sometimes we need to protect the dogs as much as they protect us. Bonnie gives the sweetest little nose kisses and absolutely loves her grown humans. She has met a horse, steer and goats with no interest. I do not know about cats. She also has an ugly scar on her front paw. She had a benign growth removed and was absolutely NOT having the cone. Bonnie really needs a home of her own to finish out her retirement years. She really is the sweetest girl and just tugging at my heartstrings to still be in the kennel. Please apply at www.krrtx.org/forms. \nPlease note all dogs are located in San Antonio, TX. We advertise out of state due to the critical pet overpopulation problem here in the south. We use Our Texas Rescue Connection to transport the dogs to your area. They are all up to date and come with a health certificate. The fee is $170 adoption and $180 transportation = $350. Thank you for considering adopting a southern dog.\n",

            "description": "Meet Dusty. He's ton of fun in a small package. He's really friendly with people. Dusty enjoys chasing his herding ball around or playing fetch. He is a super high-energy dog and needs an active owner to help him burn off energy and get the exercise a young dog needs. If you're a runner, cyclist, hiker, or if you'd like a dog to have a job like agility, Dusty could be a great fit. He does well in his crate at night. Dusty plays well with other dogs, but he does like to pester them to initiate play. He would do best in a home without cats.\n\nDusty is a small, 1 year old blue male with a docked tail. He's neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. He tested negative for heartworms and is taking heartworm prevention. He weighs 35 lbs.\n\nThanks for considering a dog from Texas Cattle Dog Rescue! We place heelers all over the state of Texas.\n\nIf you're interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application. You can download it at www.texascattledogrescue.com/adopt.html. Our standard adoption fee is $250 +tax for adult dogs, $300 +tax for puppies. Our dogs will be spayed or neutered, vaccinated and heartworm tested before going to a new home. We conduct a home visit to help match up the right dog with the right owner. For more information, visit our website www.texascattledogrescue.com.  Email adopt@texascattledogrescue.com if you have questions.",

This boy is handsome, affectionate, will greet you with hugs and kisses and is very people friendly.\n \nRoscoe has made such huge improvements since arriving at his foster home.  When they first got him, he was skin and bones and barely knew how to walk due to living in a crate most of his life.  Roscoe had major skin issues and infections all over his body.  He was also afraid of being left alone and would cry.  Today, he's gained 20lbs and struts around like he owns the place =) He is goofy and expressive and always wants to be with the family, lounging on the couch and eating snacks.\n\nHe currently lives with two small dogs and another Pitbull, but is getting more selective with time, so would be best for him to be the only dog in the home.  He still has some separation anxiety though and would love someone who is patient and can continue to work on his crate training. \n\nHis favorite game is fetch and he can't say no to a tennis ball!  Unlike the other dogs, he's not into soft squeaky toys.  However, his rubber bone is good too! \nHe's a wonderful dog that needs the love and security of the perfect family.  Hoping that is yours! \n\n\nPlease help us get sweet Roscoe into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt loving Roscoe, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.",

She does great on a leash (pulls some when she spots a squirrel), loves to go for rides, loves everyone she meets and is a perfectly house mannered girl. Bonnie has gone to work with me at times and we all forget she is there - she just snoozes and hangs out. She has done okay with some dogs in rescue but it doesn't last long so I will be firm she needs to be an only dog - period. Because she is a older I would suggest no small children - she is past babysitting age. If small kids visit your home simply put her up and protect both her and the children from any incident. Sometimes we need to protect the dogs as much as they protect us. Bonnie gives the sweetest little nose kisses and absolutely loves her grown humans. She has met a horse, steer and goats with no interest. I do not know about cats. She also has an ugly scar on her front paw. She had a benign growth removed and was absolutely NOT having the cone. Bonnie really needs a home of her own to finish out her retirement years. She really is the sweetest girl and just tugging at my heartstrings to still be in the kennel.

Privacy fence preferred but not required.\nIdeal Home: Single-person home or low-key couple. Calm, low-traffic homes where he can develop a routine are best. No apartments.\nSpecial Info: Webster bonds very closely with his human. While he is not aggressive towards new people, he is very shy and keeps his circle small. He gets excited to see his person and wants to be near them at all times. Webster's adoption fee includes one free session with our force-free trainer.\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Quail is the sweetest, most playful pup you will ever meet! She\u2019s about 2 years old and 45lbs of pure puppy happiness. \nShe loves meeting new people and dogs. Quail enjoys snuggling next to you (or on top of you) but when she\u2019s awake, she\u2019s ready to play!\n\nShe\u2019s very smart and a fast learner, is house trained and crate trained, but prefers room to play or to snuggle next to you. \nShe\u2019s a high energy girl who would love a human to spend quality, active time with her. She\u2019d do best in a home with a yard and would love another pup who enjoys playtime as much as she does. She plays hard and loves harder! \n\nShe\u2019s exceptional on a leash but can get very excited if she sees a new doggo friend. She\u2019s very food motivated, so she\u2019ll learn quickly with a little attention and training. \n\nQuail is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and preventatives, and has almost completed her heartworm treatment. \nIf you\u2019re looking for a happy & cuddly new playmate, Quail might be your girl!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

            "description": "How-do-you-do, my name is Benelli. In my spare time I was doing some research on my name and found it means \"Warrior Maid\" - I think that sounds quite valiant and noble. It also means I share a namesake with Joan of Arc and a beautiful race horse. I was returned to WCHS after 3 years by no fault of my own, my owner has a medical issue and was no longer able to give me the exercise I need. I have not had a lot of opportunity to learn proper manners but I know with daily exercise, a routine and training I will be an outstanding breed ambassador. I would be good with other dogs that are tolerant, and would likely do best with males, because I can get pushy and play rough - I am quite the spitfire. Any dog family I would need to meet to make sure we are good friends. Cats are an absolute no-no for me. I met a cat here and was quite rude with her. Although she tried to correct me, I ignored her wishes and was relentless; I simply have no respect for cats whatsoever. Children 12 years or older would be fabulous in my new home. I need the kids to be old enough to help me remember to keep four on the floor. Since I am about 55 pounds of muscle, if I jump up on a small person I know I could accidentally knock them over. I do OK with all sorts of handling as long as you don't mind me getting excited and jumping all over - just another opportunity for you to teach me some manners. I have stupendous manners with my food bowl and other valuable resources. I look forward to showing you how gently I accept treats if you ask me to sit. I also know how to catch and give kisses. I am quite the talented kiss-giver. I would love a long walk every day and other opportunities to burn some energy. I am very intelligent and think it would be fun to participate in mental activities where I can work my brilliant brain. I am playful and affectionate and promise to be a loyal and devoted companion. Come by to meet me in person and I am confident you will fall in love.",

He might be too much for some people but he is very sweet and friendly.  Duke was tested with cats and for food aggression and he passed!! He will need a home without dogs. Duke was neutered and has his rabies vaccination. \n\nDuke is located at the Manci Prison Program for training, he is not at our shelter. If you would like to set up a time to meet him you will need to send an email to: Christina.thomas@odrc.state.oh.us\n\nUPDATE FROM PRISON PROGRAM:\nDuke is very attentive dog that loves people! He's very curious about other dogs and he gets along with most. His only problem is that he focuses on dogs so intently that he makes other dogs feel uncomfortable which can lead to fight. Other than that he is completely trained.\n\nFor an adoption application you can request one via richlandcountypets@yahoo.com",

He would be a great hiking buddy or running partner.  \n-\tCurtis LOVES his toys \u2013 toys are a must!\n-\tHe would do best with a confident, playful doggy sibling. If he does not have a canine pal at home, Curtis needs a family who will take him to doggy daycare or ensure he has regular social time with other pups.\n-\tNo human kiddos under 10 years old\n-\tKitties unknown \u2013 can test for an approved adopter\n\nTo meet Curtis, please visit our website, www.pittieslovepeace.com, to submit an adoption application. Curtis is neutered, microchipped and vaccinated. His adoption fee is $250.00 and includes doggie kisses and a lifetime of LOVE.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing a predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

Nothing is known about my life before I came here. I was adopted for a few months but was returned because of a couple incidents I had with the other dog in the home and I started to become unsure of wanting to be around children. So, I would prefer to be the king of my castle and to be the only animal in the home. I am also recommended to be in a child free home, as they make me uncomfortable; however, teenagers may be okay with me. I sometimes growl when I am restrained, but I like to talk. I walk very well on a leash. I love to play and will happily lean on you and give you kisses. I was treated for Heartworms at MCAS and am a Heartworm survivor. So, here I am, ready and looking forward to my new home. Hope to meet you soon. \n\nLove, Benny.",

Definitely no male dogs in the home, no small dogs and no cats. \n\nLoki is looking for a home setting with a fenced area or fenced acreage. \n\nWe WILL NOT respond to applications that do not have the experience to work on Loki's training needs \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Loki, please read his full profile below.\n\nAn adoption application is required.  You can copy and paste the following link into your web browser\n\nhttp://lowermainlandhumanesociety.org/adoption-application/\n\n*********************\n\nLoki is a 2 year old Great Pyrenees.  He was purchased to be a house pet, but the owners realized that their busy lifestyle taking care of 4 children and having to go to work, didn't leave them enough time to dedicate to training Loki or providing him enough physical and mental stimulation. \n\nWhen he was younger and smaller he was taken to the dog park often and was good with the dog he met there.  We tested him with several different large dogs here at the shelter and in home settings and this is what we know:\n\nHe has met 2 resident large female dogs and has hung out with them regularly on the property.  When he gets over excited and tries to rough play with them, he gets told off, and he backs off and finds something else to do. \n\nHe has been in a home environment temporarily with neutered male dogs, however after a few days, he became over bearing towards the male dogs and tries to challenge them.  A home without male dogs is important..\n\nHe has played well with both female and neutered male dogs in open neutral settings such as a large fenced area. As long as the other dogs were not aggressive towards Loki. \n\nWe haven't tested him with smaller dogs but we would say that he should not live with any due to his size and goofy puppy antics.\n\nUnfortunately, Loki grew leary of the children in his previous home, therefore he should not go to a home with children of any age. \n\nLoki should not live with cats. \n\nWe will not consider apartments, condos, townhomes, basement suites.   He is looking for a home environment with a fully fenced yard or fenced acreage (minimum 5.feet), where his people won't allow Loki to bark excessively.   He would greatly benefit from a home that understands that he is still young and needs consistent boundaries, routine, and rules..   his new owner MUST continue with his ongoing training needs. \n\nHe has never been around farm animals, thus should not be with any.\n\nHe loves to hang out inside with his people, loves to get belly rubs and affection. He is very calm inside the house and loves to lounge around (as long as there aren't other animals to get him excited).  He should not be allowed on the furniture though :)\n\nHe's a good boy, and needs a human willing to put in the time and energy to provide leadership and training.  He still requires quite a bit of training, he pulls hard on leash and his recall is still a work in progress. \n\nHe is neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, flea treated\n \nHis adoption fee is $395\n\nAn adoption application and home visit is required. \n\nYou can find our application on our website \n\nhttp://lowermainlandhumanesociety.org/adoption-application/\n",

He is a smart, happy, content, playful adult who just wants to be wherever his people are! He's currently staying in an APA! foster home and is showing that he'll make a quick transition to his new home. Tux is very smart; he has wonderful manners and has been very well behaved in the house. He's housebroken and has had no accidents. He's trustworthy and hasn't gotten into any trouble, even when he's home alone. You'll find Tux to be a fantastic walking companion. He gets excited to go for his morning neighborhood walk and has great leash skills. He walks a few miles each day so he'll help you get in some extra exercise. Once back at home he enjoys a nice nap in the sun in the backyard. He's able to keep himself entertained by playing with his toys. Tux likes to toss and chase racquetballs, it's especially fun if you throw them for him! He also has his favorite rope chew toys and the stuffed fabric toys with the squeakers. He likes to have a basket where he can keep his toys organized so that he has easy access to whatever he feels like playing with next! Ultimately, Tux is a people-lover who is definitely happiest when he has his human(s) with him. He loves the people in his home, and has never met a stranger! Tux enjoys going for car rides, watching the world go by. As long as his people are close by, he'll be happy and content. And his people-pleasing attitude helps him learn rules and new commands quickly. Tux's personality will provide an even keel to your household. He would prefer to be the only pet in the household, though he'd like to be surrounded by as many people as possible. He is a sweet, loveable, happy boy who just wants everyone to love him back! A yard where he can get some extra exercise and sunbathing would be ideal. And don't forget, when you adopt from APA! you'll also be helping the next dog who can join us! Come meet Tux today!",

Meet and greets will be held in Tarzana, CA\n\nhttps://pawsitivetailstoremember.forms-db.com/view.php?id=17980\n\nSUNNY is 2 years old, she weighs 7.6  lbs, and is a tan and white female Chihuahua with a sweet but very shy face and personality. A little bit of history on Sunny\u2019s past life; she was surrendered in June by her owner for a supposed bite incident to a finger who claims that she was given to him as a gift and he was losing his home and could no longer keep her. Her shelter video was heartbreaking and you could see her visibly shaking in her kennel; they made her RESCUE ONLY and the rescue community rallied around to network her and we ultimately took a chance and pulled her. Sunny was with our foster who specializes in behavioral dogs and she brought her to the next stage where we moved her to her current foster for more socialization. We do feel that she will only continue to thrive and to progress in her forever home. If we keep her too long with this foster it will completely set her back when we adopt her out.           \n\nSunny has definitely suffered trauma in her young life and she will require a special family to give her time to heal and to learn to trust people again. We do not recommend any young children in the home and she must have a quiet environment. We will NOT  consider any home that does not have a second small dog preferably a bit older but young enough to be able to interact and play with Sunny. \n \nSunny Facts:\n\n\u2022\tHouse trained using a doggie door (there will be a transition period in a new home)\n\u2022\tStill perfecting her leash training, but I must say that she is doing great!\n\u2022\tSunny is extremely shy, lacks confidence and she will need a family willing to work on her issues in a calm and quiet manner. Sunny will need to trust you first, but she has come a very long way from the absolutely terrified and shaking dog that we rescued. \n\u2022\tSunny loves other small dogs and is cat friendly\n\u2022\tSunny is microchipped, current on vaccines and is spayed \n\u2022\tThis sweet and shy girl will continue to blossom with love and care and another dog in the home.\n\nLike most dogs, Sunny would love nothing more than a warm lap and a family to call her own. She gets along well with other dogs and cats, therefore, there MUST be at least one other small dog in the home and she would do best in a quiet and calm environment with a retired couple, active single or a family with children 14 and older. \n\n",

She is very smart and catches on quickly to what you are teaching her, but she needs consistency to excel in her obedience. \n\nPebbles gets along with male dogs when properly introduced. She would do best in a home as an only pet or with a male dog that is playful but not aggressive. Pebbles should not be in a home with cats. Pebbles loves people but she would be best in a home without small children as she can be a bit to rambunctious.\nPebbles is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on her vaccinations.

            "description": "HAZEL is quite the character! You would never know she was found abandoned in Northern Arizona with a very limited chance of being adopted by a loving family there. When a plea was sent out for help, our rescue agreed to help find her that perfect home. This big goofball loves to play, chase the ball and roll over for endless tummy rubs. Check out that tongue, lots of kisses for everyone!!\n\nHazel will do best as the only dog in the household. Hazel is a good girl and loves to keep her kennel clean, so housetraining will be super easy when she gets into her own forever home. Hazel will do well when included as a 'family member' who will never be 'left outside, alone' again! She loves to please and will be so easy to teach basic, general commands. She is responding very quickly to leash training, too and will love a nice walk around the neighborhood as the weather starts to cool down. New sounds can startle her, so your patience will be appreciated when bringing her into your home. Remember how noisy those vacuums are or outdoor spraying sprinklers? She will look to you to reassure her that these are normal 'home' sounds.\n\nHazel has been vaccinated, microchipped and will be spayed this week. Her dream home should provide her with lots of human interaction and a great grassy yard to play in. Hazel is approximately 18 months old with a medium, stocky build and a great big, old head that just loves to be petted! She has a beautiful gray/brown coat with a super tuxedo chest. What a looker!\n\nIf you would like more info on Hazel, or want to meet her to see if she is a good match for your home, please complete our online application at www.helpadogsmile.org and a volunteer will be in contact with you. As we do home visits and stay in contact with each new owner during the adoption process, we limit our adoptions to the Phoenix metro area. Hazel's adoption fee of $250 helps with medical expenses of the rescue. Thank you for considering a loving rescue doggy!",

            "description": "Goober alert! Bodie is all puppy inside his brain. He is curious about absolutely everything, and follows that curiosity beyond reason. When he gets himself into a bind, he can really pour on the drama, putting on a world-class pout and keeping woe-is-me puppy-dog eyes at the ready to get sympathy. We confess - it works! Bodie is energetic and adventurous, tackling the playground equipment with happy abandon and impressive athleticism. He knows his manners but likes to see if maybe he doesn't have to use them (flash back to \"puppy-dog eyes\" and pouts). Treats, toys, and adorable head tilts round out his favorite things. Honestly, life is pretty much his favorite thing. [Unfortunately, tho, other animals are not his favorite. But he will bring you a wealth of entertainment as an only pet!]\n\n \n\n~  Est DOB: May 2016\n~  Est weight:  60#  \n~  Bodie comes with free training - ask for details!  \n~  Adoption details/application:  calhouncountyhs.blogspot.com/p/adopt.html",

Arrow is housebroken and has mastered basic tricks. He is quick to learn anything else you want to teach. He is good on a leash, and enjoys walking with most dogs. But what he loves most is playing fetch, swimming, playing fetch, walking with friends, playing fetch and hanging out with a loving companion. He bonds with those he spends time with like regular volunteer walkers and adoption counselors. He would love to bond with a new best friend (no kids please)! If you are looking for a faithful companion, you\u2019ll find one no better than Arrow.\nPlease visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/ to learn more about our dogs.

I also love kids as long as they aren't too boisterous, so no babies or toddlers please. I'm shy at first, but warm up quickly to you. I am neutered, microchipped, and vaccinated. I have been treated for heartworms (fast kill) and am proud to say I am now heartworm negative. I had a rough past, that found me in a municipal shelter and shut down, but now I am learning to be a dog. I am lazy and love to be indoors. I only go outside to do my business in the fenced yard, then come back in to lounge around. My adoption fee is $200 Houston area (out of state $550 including health certificate and transport fee) and you can apply at www.soca-fbc.org/adoptables.",

They will probably be happiest in a home where they are the only pets. We did have Tigger's right eye looked at, and the vet said there was a puncture injury at some point, and it will heal over time. He can see some out of that eye.\n*update: We hate to do this, but there has not been any interest in Winnie and Tigger except for a couple homes that have cats . We really would like to keep them together, but it looks like we may need to separate them. Having them sit in a kennel is not helping them, or the dogs we could have saved if we had their spots. We know it's asking a lot to adopt 2 dogs at once, and even with the added incentive of a partially sponsored adoption, there is no one applying for them. So, we are willing to split them up. They are both good dogs and house trained. Winnie takes treats very gently, Tigger not so much. Winnie sits right away when you ask, Tigger likes to stand on his back legs like, well, Tigger! Winnie loves toys. They did live with other dogs at their foster home down south, but up here we haven't had any luck with matching them up with play mates. \nBoth don't like cats. Tigger is about 7 years old and 50#. Winnie is about 5 years old and 65#. \n\nWe know they came from the same household in Alabama, and that their owner knew they were at the Chattahoochee Humane Society, and never went and got them. Tigger has some suspicious scars on him, so it's probably best they didn't come back for them. \nTheir adoption fee has been partially sponsored if adopted together!\nThe adoption application can be found at www.northcountrypetadoption.org",

He is housebroken, walks nicely on leash, is attentive, smart, great in the car, and loves to be with his person/people. He is between 10-12 years of age, but has pep in his step for sure. He had been surrendered back to us recently due to his being nervous around the young child and new baby in the family, so an adult home would be best. He loves to play ball, go for walks, and just hang out -- he's the perfect companion. He is not crazy about sharing his home with another pet so he would be your only, but he really is a very easy and sweet dog. He's only about 50-55 lbs,, is in great shape, and ready to live out his golden years in a loving home.",

            "description": "Jack is approximately 1 1/2 years old. He is a border collie/blue heeler mix. Jack is very obedient and just wants to please. He is good off leash and on leash. He gets along well with other dogs and is a bit afraid of the cats. We have learned that Jack needs another dog for confidence. He will do best in a home with another dog that is confident that can show him the ropes. When he is in a home environment without another dog, he is anxious and nervous and will try to hide. Transitioning to a new home will take him some time to adjust but if you have patience, he is such loving dog.\nJack's ideal home would be a farm type environment. He has spent most of his life outside, so he is not very comfortable in a home and will need time to adjust to house living. He loves to be out with the animals and following his owner around. He would probably do best in a home with older dog savvy children as loud noises and quick movements can make him nervous. When he gets worried, his reaction is to run back to his kennel. He prefers to hide when he is nervous.\nJack has been neutered, is up to date on his vaccinations and is micro-chipped. Schedule a time to come meet this sweet dog today!",

My name is the combination of two French words \u201cmon\u201d and \u201cami\u201d which mean \u201cmy friend\u201d.    I came to Halfway to Home shortly after I was adopted from the Lancaster shelter because my owner passed away.  I am looking for a special mature and compassionate person or couple to give me a forever home with a lot of love and understanding.   I have a neurological condition called cerebral hyperplasia.  It is caused by the underdevelopment of a part of my brain called the cerebellum, which is responsible for coordination, balance and depth perception.  I appear to have only mild symptoms, and only in rare cases does it get worse over time.  The most obvious symptoms I have is that I walk very \u201ccarefully\u201d because I perceive myself being off-balance (very similar to a horse gait), and when you try to give me a treat or throw me ball, I don\u2019t see it right away so it takes a little while for me to find it.  I can still run and play, but it is important that my new home keep me safe from self-harm that can be caused by small obstacles or uneven surfaces.  Stairs are very challenging for me so I would need someone with me to guide me up and down.  Loud noises startle me so I need a quiet home with no children or other pets.  Other than my physical challenges, I am like other Huskies.  I love to \u201ctalk\u201d and will engage in conversations with my humans.  Regular brushing is needed because I shed more than most breeds.  A fenced yard would be preferable but I would probably be ok in a condo or apartment as long as it is on the ground floor and I get daily walks to keep me stimulated and fit.  So, what do you think?  Would you like to be \u201cmon ami\u201d?  I have a lot of love to give and with some patience I think you will see that I make a wonderful companion.   If you are interested in learning more about me or making an appointment to meet me, please call Sandy at tele#661-824-4495 (this is a landline).  I hope to meet you soon!",

She came to us crying out in (apparent) pain so often that we wondered how severe her health condition actually was. Well, per our veterinarian, Daisy is just scared of being handled by strangers. The moment this little doll settles into your home she will lavish you with love and attention. Daisy is the kind of little dog who really wants to be someone's dog. We can tell that although she gets along ok with other dogs, she really was an only dog- though she does play with the neighbor's dog at her foster home. She seeks and gives so much affection.\n\nDaisy has been to the vet and we've done the typical blood workup on her. Our vet told us that while we thought she was a senior, she may actually be much closer to 5, given her health and the condition of her teeth.\n\nSo, if you want an adorable companion and are willing to put in a little time initially to acclimate her to your home, Daisy is your girl!  No youth under the age of 12 please.",

He did great with surgery and was a sweetheart at the vet. What we found when placing him, is that he attaches to one person and gets protective of them. So we are looking for a new home that is a single person that will adopt him, understanding that when you have people come over to your house, he will need crated. He is crate trained and obedient to single.owner. The rescue will provide training by a professional for adopter at the expense of the rescue.

He is currently at our farm and learning about farm animals. He does well with other dogs with proper introductions. Rocky does well off leash on the farm and has good recall. In a more urban environment a leash would be best. He will need some work on leash as he likes to pull a bit.\n\nRocky came to us as a stray so we don't have much information about his background. He is good about just sleeping on his bed and not destroying it, so he has likely been an indoor dog. He likes to play with toys but is also content to just investigate his area. He is very friendly and happy to see people, but with his high energy he would be best in a home with older children.\n\nHe is now neutered, up to date on all shots and is microchipped. If you would like to meet Rocky, please email or call us to set up a meet and greet.",

Betty came into Cody's from a local shelter. She is around 4 years old and 40lbs. In her foster home she is learning how to play with dogs, learning crate training, and potty training. She will need a very solid crate as she does not love being crated.. She loves people and has never met a stranger. We haven't seen her around children but we think she would be great with kids - the more love the better for Betty. She is heart worm positive but we are treating her and she will be just fine. \n\nOverall Betty is a very calm dog. She prefers snuggling with her humans but loves to play with other dogs of all sizes. . Betty enjoys walks and would do fine in an apartment (must not have breed restrictions) or house. She does have separation anxiety so would love a home where home more than not. She hass burns on her back and we do't think she was loved in her previous home. She cowers and runs sometimes but we just love on her even more.\n\nBetty can be a little shy in new situations and she would love an adopter who can continue to love her and build her confidence.\n\n \n\nApplications are at https://bit.ly/codys_adoption_application.",

She is arthritic and hearing and vision impaired, but that doesn\u2019t keep her from snuggling or going on adventures. She would do best in a home with carpeted floors but does well with grippy socks in her foster home. She is inquisitive, loving and smart as a whip. If you have a couch but no cuddle buddy, consider adopting Shatzi!\n\nShatzi is current on vaccines, spayed and microchipped. \n",

            "description": "Meet Belle!  She is a two year old mixed breed bundle of energy, likely part pit bull.  She is a rescue that we got Christmas, 2018.  Belle is spayed, up to date on all shots, heart worm negative, chipped and very healthy.  She weighs about 65 pounds and is very athletic and fast.  Belle loves to run, chase and catch tennis balls, and go for walks.  She\u2019s very enthusiastic when meeting people and enjoys playing with our grandkids. Belle is selective in her dog friends and can become anxious around other dogs.  She has never been around cats.  Belle is house trained and enjoys her bath and shoulder massages.  She likes belly rubs and going to her crate for naps.  She learns quickly and knows basic commands.  Belle can jump high and needs a 6 foot fenced in yard.  She enjoys sitting on the patio with us and relaxing in the sun.  We are senior citizens, and Belle has become too strong for us to handle.  She would thrive with a younger, athletic family.  We love her dearly but realize she needs a more active environment than we can provide.  Please consider Belle as an addition to your family.\n\nIf interested in Bell please email rideaususan@gmail.com",
