            "description": "Location: New Orleans, Louisiana \n\nDakota was apart of a cruelty case in North Louisiana. Cane Haven Rescue pulled her from the shelter to give her another chance at life. Dakota is approximately 2 years old, up to date on vaccinations, spayed & microchipped. \n\nDakota has had quite a rough beginning to her life. When animal control seized Dakota, she had chemical burn on her entire spine area.  The burn was completely healed but she was obviously being over bred for puppies. There was another dog on the property, Dorian who had similar burns on his shoulder blades. We are confident that their previous owners were doing this torturous act on purpose. \n\nDakota is house trained, kennel trained & knows her basic commands/manners. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Dakota, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

I love walks and hanging out.  I do have a prey drive so cats are not in the cards either.  I can be dog selective, but as you can tell by my pictures, I do like other dogs, just not all of them.  A dog park might be something I would have to work up to.  I really would like a structured environment to help me feel safe.  I would love to have experienced owners, as I do need a pack leader.  I feel much more content, when I am not the one making the rules.  \n\nMeet-Your-Match Canine-ality color is: Orange- Busy Bee!!\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info\n\n",

            "description": "Sweet Elsa was born in November 2014. She loves to show off her cute smile! She loves to play and run around, so a secure, fenced yard is a must. She can be a good running partner but gets distracted easily by other dogs, rabbits, and squirrels. So instead, walking is a much better option. She weighs in at a muscular 78 lbs. She is very kind to everyone but she doesn't realize how strong she is. Care must be taken around very small children and the elderly so she doesn't bump into them. While she loves being loved, she is also very protective of those she lives with making her an excellent loyal dog. She generally sleeps on a dog bed but has no issue plopping down and taking a nap anywhere. She does not do well with other dogs, particularly if they are smaller than her.\n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

It is also essential that Pearl continue with her weekly physical therapy until the vet discharges her.  Although she would be fine being the one and only fur-baby, Pearl has spent a lot of time with other dogs and really enjoys playing with them.  Additionally, she recently met our office cat, so it is possible, with proper introductions, Pearl would happily live with cats too.  \n\nWon't you consider being a mother of Pearl...or father?\n\nAdopters must live in the Los Angeles area.",

Pearl's back was so badly broken, the veterinarian that first examine Pearl said it was amazing that Pearl even survived such a severe injury...her spinal cord was essentially severed.  After months of physical therapy, Pearl is able to run around with her doggy friends but it is likely that one of her legs will never be completely normal.  She may require a back leg bootie long term for protection but it will not slow her down a bit.  Due to the paralysis, Pearl also requires bladder expression throughout the day but she can poop on her own.",

She's a beautiful girl who loves everyone she meets! Josie's ideal family/person will have a quiet, structured home with a solid routine. She'll be an eager companion for runs, hikes, daily walks & playtime in a fenced in yard. If you've ever considered trying dog agility, Josie would be up for that, too!\n\nMiss Josie would prefer to have someone who's home more than they're away, but she's been making great progress with crate training. This sweet soul is a sensitive one; she needs your love, respect and patience in order to thrive. She's smart as a whip and eager to please; she'll gain confidence as you help her learn your daily household routine.\n\nJosie doesn't like loud noises or chaos; she'd be happiest in a suburban or rural setting and we're recommending only older, respectful children. Josie is dog selective, so a meet and greet with any resident or frequently visiting dogs is a must! And no cats for this little lady!\n\nIf you're looking for a sweet, active girl who will enjoy cuddling on the couch as much as hiking through the woods with you, Josie could be the one for you!\n\n** Follow Josie's journey on Instagram at @josie_ditr\n\n*** Please note, we do not adopt out to Canada due to BSL and Border Issues\n\nAdoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

This beautiful girl was an owner surrender because they had no time for her and kept her in a pen all the time.\n\nCheyenne is a sweet girl. She loves to be with her people. She is good with kids and other non-aggressive dogs. She is gentle, even-tempered, goofy and playful. She has a great recall and knows to sit, and sometimes to go down, on command. She does NOT want to be left outside, but doesn't panic if you go inside for a few minutes. Meet and greets need to be supervised and if she needs to be corrected, she accepts it willingly. She does NOT appear to be aggressive but makes a lot of noise when she plays. So you might misunderstand her. If you're looking for a great companion, Cheyenne is your girl!\n\nShe is house- and crate-trained. She is heartworm positive and on treatment. She is fully vetted, spayed and microchipped.\n\nPlease visit Regard4Life Animal Rescue at Petsmart in Longview on Saturdays for more information. You can also review our adoption album at http://Regard4Life.org or email regard4life.info@gmail.com.",

When not sunbathing, I love to curl up next to you on the couch.\n\nI really love meeting new people and dogs, however I do have a high prey drive and wouldn't recommend any introductions to cats or chickens.\n\nI'm crate trained and do great at potty training when on a schedule. If you are interested in a fun, sassy pup, I'm your girl.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

She has the coloring, expressive eyes, small underbite, and temperament of the boxer and the small size, ears, face and 'I own the world' attitude of a chihuahua. She was born paralyzed in the hind end, and the joints in her rear legs are mis-aligned. She was left outside of a hotel and was rescued and sent to APA for treatment! Saisy's right leg had to be amputated and she cannot use my left one. However, she is very mobile with a wheelchair and by hopping. Due to the paralysis she cannot control her bowels and bladder, so she wears diapers and must be cleaned and changed several times a day. But she pays you back in spades with little loving kisses. She is a happy, active, and playful girl who enjoys a game of ball and is a champ at tug of war. But she is mostly happy just being with her person. If you have room for this sweet girl in your home and heart, she will reward you with a lifetime of loyalty, companionship and love.",

She's not pushy and doesn't beg for attention, but she will politely ask for it by rolling over and showing her belly when you pass by. She's also been good around older children from toddler on up and was very sweet with all of them. While some may think that being blind would present a lot of challenges and extra work, Darby has successfully been able to create a mental map when she has been in a home, and she became so confident navigating the layout that she would gallop though the house at a faster place. When you call her name, Darby will give you the sweetest little head tilt as she tries to figure out where you are! On top of that, she has exceptional manners. As in she's absolutely perfect - she doesn't get on furniture, she's non-destructive, does great being left home alone uncrated and is fully house-trained. She also doesn't need much exercise! Darby would do best in a home as the solo dog because she loves all the attention from her humans. More than anything, Darby just wants to feel love from those around her. If you're looking for a sweet, well-mannered, low maintenance, and easy-going cutie patootie, you won't find better than our Darby. Come meet her!",

            "description": "Hmmmm, what can we say about Rosie?? She is approx between 10-12 years old. She is a Master Crumb Detector.....doesn't care to have her feets touched....pretty sensitive all over her body actually, not a fan of being brushed.....likes to rub her face on things....also prone to eating dirt if given the chance.....has some arthuritis, you might hear some crackling in her shoulders at times, and she walks a bit funny, and she's not too steady on her feet sometimes.....not sure how much she can see, maybe more than we think but who knows....most of the time she acts like she can't hear but a loud sneeze when she's sleeping proves she can.....she coughs sometimes but it's not bad....she keeps herself busy sometimes with just walking from here to there back to here over to there..m...she does play with toys sometimes and it's the cutest thing....she's pretty easy going.... if there's another dog in the house it would have to be an older, calmer dog that would just respect Rosie space. Rosie is on Galliprant, Dasuquin and a cough medicine, all of which she will need the remainder of her life. \n\nOur adoption process starts with our application. Once the application is approved, a member of Legacy will contact you to set up a home visit. The home visit usually last 1-1 1/2 hours and is to make sure our dog and any current dogs/cats are getting along, as well as both of us agreeing it's a fit. At this time the adoption fee is due, and begins the 2 week trial. We will check in during the 2 week trial. If it's not working, our dog is returned to the foster home and all except $100.00 {$75 if Senior} of the adoption fee is returned. At the end of the 2 week trial, you decide if you will finalize the adoption - if finalized, the Adoption Contract is signed and all medical records are turned over to you. If at any time you need to rehome the dog it contractually needs to be returned to Legacy Dog Rescue.\n\nADOPTION FEE's:\nPuppies under 6 months:  $199.00\nAdults:  $150.00\nSeniors (over 7 yrs):  $99.00\n\nIf you are interested in one of our dogs please fill out an application: \nhttps://form.jotform.com/193425528783165",

            "description": "Toby Tucker is a sweet, playful 2-year-old pit bull mix (with a hint of Boston Terrier in him:) He was pulled from a GA shelter to save his life.\n\nThis 48-lb. boy loves people and loves to play, but can chill and lean on you for comfort. After a slow introduction, Toby seems to get along fine with other dogs. He is very excitable and meeting new dogs should be limited and closely supervised initially. Toby would benefit greatly from an experienced dog owner who has the time and patience to take him through obedience classes and help him gain confidence. Toby is crate-trained, potty-trained and does well on a leash. He would love to have a fenced yard to run around in, but that's not a requirement.\n\nToby is neutered, UTD on vaccines and microchipped. He is on the slow-kill treatment for heartworm infection, but should turn negative in about 6 months. The medication needed for this treatment comes along with him and is just a monthly application between his shoulder blades (Advantage Multi).\n\nTo find out more about Toby Tucker, call his buddy, Susie, at 706-726-2221. Toby is presently in Aiken, SC. His adoption fee is $225.00 The 1st step is always an application found at: www.bostonterriertn.org We prefer homes with pet experience and current pet history is a plus.\n\nNOTE: Submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston, since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.\n\nPlease use the foster momma or dad's contact information above for questions.\nThe process always begins with an application which can be found at The Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee website\nNote that in most cases, we do not adopt to families with small children, e.g., 'under 6,' as a precaution to the child's safety and the dog's safety. In some cases with larger Boston mixes or other dogs, we do make exceptions. Please ask the foster momma.\nWe prefer to place dogs within driving distance of where they are being fostered. If someone from outside the local area is approved for adoption, they must be willing to personally drive/fly to get the dog. The East Coast division (NC/SC/VA/MD/DC) does have special transport capabilties for their kids. Ask them.\nAlso, submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.",

            "description": "Meet Gracie - also known as the princess!  She loves attention, and even more so she loves to chase a ball!  She is approximately 10 years old, and on a diet with a few pounds to lose. She was found running the streets of Youngstown, eating cat food from a feral colony.    She can be placed with another dog, we think a calm dog would be best but she has responded well with certain dogs, all with different personalities, so it\u2019s really up to Grace! Grace\u2019s foster mom has been working on her barking as she is very protective of her foster home so an apartment situation would not be an option.  So far, since Grace responds well to commands she is doing nicely with barking while outside in her fenced yard with her foster mom.  When inside she\u2019s much quieter and her foster mom is appreciative of the protection so she is not redirected.\n\nGracie loves her morning and evening shortish walks and enjoys meeting new people.  She has graduated from a confidence building class at Dogsmartz Unleashed and it did her a world of good.  She is a very smart girl and will need a family that will keep her mind active and challenged.  Gracie has her limits on extremely far walks and how many times she is allowed to chase her ball but is very good at games like \u201cFind It\u201d, Touch, Target and \u201cPush\u201d (the ball lol) among others. She recently learned to drop her ball in the kiddie pool and retrieve it after it floats to the other side! Self-taught   She can be a couch potato and she will chill and watch a good movie with you. It took her a few months to trust people again after her long ordeal by herself.  Now that she is more confident and secure Grace\u2019s main priority is to be with her human. She will sleep in the kitchen quietly at night or when she is left alone but she is always so excited to be back with her person when you return.\n\nGrace came to Legacy with extreme matting and does not like to be groomed.  Possibly from a bad experience or never being groomed at all.  She will need to be bathed and trimmed at a very experienced groomer, with patience. Her foster has worked with her and is able to trim her easily with scissors and electric trimmer. Her activity level does need monitored as she does have some arthritis that is controlled by anti-inflammatories when she is uncomfortable.\n\nApplication can be found on our website, www.ldrofohio.org.\n\nOur adoption process starts with our application. Once the application is approved, a member of Legacy will contact you to set up a home visit. The home visit usually last 1-1 1/2 hours and is to make sure our dog and any current dogs/cats are getting along, as well as both of us agreeing it's a fit. At this time the adoption fee is due, and begins the 2 week trial. We will check in during the 2 week trial. If it's not working, our dog is returned to the foster home and all except $100.00 {$75 if Senior} of the adoption fee is returned. At the end of the 2 week trial, you decide if you will finalize the adoption - if finalized, the Adoption Contract is signed and all medical records are turned over to you. If at any time you need to rehome the dog it contractually needs to be returned to Legacy Dog Rescue.\n\nADOPTION FEE's:\nPuppies under 6 months:  $199.00\nAdults:  $150.00\nSeniors (over 7 yrs):  $99.00\n\nIf you are interested in one of our dogs please fill out an application: \nhttps://form.jotform.com/193425528783165",

Roselyn began the critical care needed to keep Dimitri alive and ready to fight for his life.\nDimitri is 3-5 years old, 50 pounds and fully vetted.\nHe has been seen by a trainer and it has been suggested that he be the only dog in the household to love and adore. He is not aggressive but does like attention. Dimitri is currently living outdoors in a kennel run in Puerto Rico. To fly to the Northeast, he will need a foster home or adoptive family with no other animals. Home check required.\nDimitri is looking for a new best friend or multiple best friends to share daily adventures of walks, runs and ball throwing, completed with a nap or bedtime curled at your feet.\nOur adoption application can be found on our website on the adoptable dogs page.\nThank you!\n",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Fable. I lived in Conch Arizona until I came to this shelter in August 2020. The shelter manager here at this shelter saw a post on Facebook about over 30 dogs that needed to be rescued from a property in Arizona. Luckily, the shelter had some open space, and rescued 4 of us.The people who surrendered me said that people kept dumping dogs outside of their home, and they were moving, so they could no longer keep us. They did get quite a few of us spayed/neutered, but there were just too many of us to keep up with, and there was no way they could take all of us. When I first arrived here at this shelter, I was very shy and skittish. I am still pretty shy with new people, but I warm up pretty quickly if you are patient with me. I get along well with most other dogs. I have been temperament tested with cats, and I am a little scared of them, but not aggressive towards them.  I would love to find a calm and quiet home with patient people who will work with me at a pace I am comfortable with. I have never really been around small children, but I could do well with older children who can respect my space until I am comfortable with them. If you have any questions about me, or are interested in meeting me outside of my kennel, please ask staff.\n                                                                              Love,\n                                                                                   Fable",

For this reason, Cody is food aggressive and will need to be fed by himself in a crate. He is trained to go into a crate and sit and wait on his food. Cody does NOT like large dogs, so we recommend Cody have a private, fenced back yard area to exercise. Fenced yard will be verified. Cody needs some one who has time for him and would be beneficial to get basic obedience training.\n\nAlcovy dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on all vaccines, up to date on heart-worm preventative and flea preventative and micro-chipped.\nIf interested in adoption, please complete an online application on Alcovy Pet Rescue's website at www.alcovypet.com. You must have a vet reference to adopt. We verify the care of past/current pets. Applications without a vet reference will not be approved for adoption. Our goal is to have the very best home for all our dogs and cats and therefore we reserve the right to approve or deny an application based on what we determine is in the pet's best interest.",

            "description": "Alley is a 10yr old spayed female Alaskan Malamute mix . She is about 100 lbs. Alley appears to be house trained and was well loved at one time. She also has shown us that she knows a few tricks.  She has a heart of gold and loves attention. She is a very strong girl who would do best with older children  because of her size. She deserves a home that can allow her freedom of movement. A fenced yard is what we would prefer. She prefers to be the only pet. If you want to truly make a difference in a dog's life then Alley is your girl. She  is up to date on shots and wormed.  She is already spayed.  The adoption fee is $100.  If interested in meeting this cutie, please email heritagefarms08@gmail.com or call the foster  at 248-670-0668. She is being fostered in Holly , Michigan.  When emailing please include information about you and your family including other pets.",

Mr. Wilson being one of them. While he was being kept at this facility, he held held outside in a small 3x4 pen for YEARS. For YEARS, he was kept in this manner and was never adopted out. He was taken in by another rescue who put him in a board and traing facility to rehabilitate him from his past life. He was then adopted out finally, but this adopter returned him to the shelter claiming he did not get a long with her own dog. Castaways has Mr Wilson now, and he is living with another trainer while he is looking for his forever home. He is AMAZING with small children, he is a little dog selective and does well around his foster's cat. He would make a great nanny dog or a solo companion.",

She arrived to us withdrawn, scared with mutliple cuts and scratches all over her body. Months later Daisy is responding to love and attention but still mostly on her terms. She is super smart and always appears keenly aware of her surroundings. After her morning snuggles she loves to chase squirrels and hunt for lizards and frogs with her foster brother. She's an adorable tomboy that seriously loves to hunt. She also seriously loves ice cream! Like her brother Deputy she has a long body and the east/west facing chubby front paws. Her foster Dad calls them her big clown feet! Daisy's rich lush coat is such a deep black it has a brilliant shine. Her soft ears perfectly frame her feminine face and you've never seen more expressive eyes. Daisy is good with other dogs of all ages & sizes and gets along well with cats. Her experience with kids is limited due to the pandemic. https://awo.petstablished.com/pets/public/816345\n\nDaisy and her siblings have been together since birth. They were 4.5 months old when taken into rescue. Living in the woods and surviving on their own has made them very shy around strangers. It has taken months of love, patience and a lot of understanding to build trust with their foster family. \n\nDaisy's foster family feels she will adjust best in a home with another dog. A family or individuals experienced with the challenges often faced when adopting a rescue dog. Middle school-High school age kids preferrred. \n\nDaisy has an adventourous spirit and desire to love and be loved. Also quirky, funny & animated, she will make you laugh & smile. She is a work in progress that will require an extra level of committment. She is a wonderful girl that deseves a special family,",

Loyal. Outspoken. Stubborn. Determined. Great appreciation for food -- even vegetables.\nWhat makes us smile: When she\u2019s really excited, she pants and it sounds like she's cheering \u201cYeah! Yeah! Yeah!\u201d She's always, without fail, thrilled when her humans walk into the room.\nDay job: Gossip Columnist. She has the inside scoop on everything happening in the neighborhood and will happily give you minute to minute updates.\nLittle Miss Character: Little Miss Chatterbox\nWhat she loves most: Tie between food and her people. Followed by the giant dog beds.\nWorking on: Barking at various beings on walks. Not needing to have the last word with other dogs. Reigning in her excited love nibbles and kisses to feet and ankles. Just between us...also sharing her dog bed but Monica says this isn't something she's willing to work on, thank you very much. \nDogs: Take them or leave them. Talks a lot of s**t initially but then she gets over herself.\nCats: Pass.\nKiddos: Dog-savvy kids only! She gets overwhelmed when there\u2019s a lot of commotion and prefers gentle pets and snuggles. \nHousebroken: Sure is, but needs to be kept on a schedule including going outside as soon as her people come home -- even after 10 minutes.\nCrate Trained: Yep! Has no problem going right into her crate for bed or when her family is out of the house.\nMonica is spayed, vaccinated, heartworm negative, and microchipped. She\u2019s available for adoption to residents of CT and surrounding states. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application on our website.",

Her foster mama wrote a bio for her\nShe is a pit mix, around 50 pounds and aprox 5 years old\n\nAfter a life of neglect, abuse and multiple \u00a0pregnancies Pickle has settled into her foster home. \u00a0After a few weeks, \u00a0pickle is finally relaxing and her cute personality shines. \u00a0She loves to cuddle,\u00a0has perfect house manners and gets along great with a playful 50lb male dog. \u00a0 Pickle is also good on a leash but needs some work because she gets excited when she sees people or dogs on her walks but is getting better with it. She is crate trained and housebroken however she would be best in a home with no cats or small animals. She is in a foster with older children and is good with them. \nApplications can be found at sophiescircle.com",

Barnie is about 4-5 yrs old and still an active boy if you want , or a snuggler too. Barnie is crate and leash trained. He does have a deep beagle bark when exploring if he sees a squirrel. Otherwise, just a handsome , sweet boy looking for love. YOU can apply at wags-rescue.org",

She is good with all people, especially active ones. Kate would love a fun running/hiking human to keep her active and happy. Her exuberance may be a little too much for smaller children in the household. After all the fun and activity, there is nothing better for Kat than a little cuddle time with the family.\n\nKat LOVES water and also loves the kiddie pool. She'll make a great swimmer!\n\nKat has shown some selectiveness with certain dogs, so she will either need appropriate dog introductions or the only dog in the home. She has not been cat tested.\n\nWon't you give this sweet girl a home? She can't wait to meet her new family.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pup, please email info@underdogaz.com or visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com",

When Jade first came into rescue, she was diagnosed with bilateral medial patella luxation and has since received corrective surgery and has recovered nicely. Given her young age, it is believed that as Jade continues to build strength, she will continue to improve and will not be impacted in her daily activities. Despite all this, Jade has the most positive personality and is always eager for some fun times! So far, Jade has befriended all the doggie pals she has met, and gets along well with the resident felines. Perhaps due to being confined during her crate rest, Jade is not a big fan of other humans entering her property, but she is diligently learning that visitors mean more love and cuddles to go around :) Jade is hoping for a dog buddy in her furever family who can show her the way around navigating the human world. Although Jade had a rough start in life, this lovely girl is eager to bring her positive spirits to one lucky family!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

I was the runt of the litter and should not be over 50lbs but the rescue folks think about 40lbs.  The nice rescue people rescued myself, siblings and mommy from a bad situation in LA. I am a sweet girl who adores snuggle time and have bursts of puppy playtime then sleep. I am kennel/crate trained and have learned to use the doggie door EVERY time to potty. I am a smart cookie who learns quickly. I am doing very well with the leash training thing. My foster mommy tells me I am a very good girl and am ready for my furever home. I do well with other doggies, large or small and all humans are great snuggle partners and perfect for puppy kisses. Are you ready for me to be your smart, loving, good girl furever?",

His antics are guaranteed to make you smile & his desire to be loved will warm your heart! This good boy has mastered the army crawl and is working on his \"not ready for MLB ball skills\" (check out his video).\n\nBenny is looking for a very active person to walk, hike and play with to burn off some energy; afterwards, he'll just want to hang out & be near you. He is highly treat and praise motivated! He's a quick learner and already knows some basic commands; he'll need your guidance and understanding to help him perfect his manners. Our trainer will partner with you and Benny to ensure success!\n\nBenny is house-trained & does great in a crate; like a lot of young dogs, he has a tendency to chew things if he's bored & unsupervised. Benny currently needs to be an only pet or kept separate from resident pets; he's awkward and unsure around other dogs. No cats or small animals for this guy!\n\nUpon meeting Benny for the first time, our volunteer told us, 'He's a great dog, he's going to make someone very happy\". Could it be you? Please fill out a foster or adoption application today and let's find out!\n\n**We do not adopt to Canada due to breed specific legislation and border restrictions**\nAdoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

            "description": "Bo is a big, strong handsome hound with an effortless stride and commanding presence. He loves being with his brothers, sister and foster siblings. He can be very reserved and always approaches new situations with caution. Bo loves exploring the outdoors. He is fast, athletic and a joy to watch run and play. He is good with other dogs of all ages & sizes (once he gets to know them and is comfortable) and has been introduced to cats. Kid testing has been very limited due to the pandemic. \n\nBo and his siblings have been together since birth. They were 4.5 months old when taken into rescue. Living in the woods and surviving on their own has made them very shy around strangers. It has taken months of love, patience and understanding to build trust with their foster family. \n\nBo's foster family feels he will adjust best in a home with another dog. A family or individuals experienced with the challenges often faced when adopting a rescue dog. Middle school-High school age kids preferrred. \n\nBo has a quiet spirit and gentle soul. But he is a work in progress that will require an extra level of committment. He is a wonderful boy that deseves a special family,\n\n https://awo.petstablished.com/pets/public/816347",

He walks decent on a leash, but needs someone to continue to work with him. Because of his size we feel a home without small kids, would be best. He seems to get along with other dogs but a meet and greet with potential siblings would be needed.\nIf interested in meeting this big boy please contact Vicki @ 570 784 3669 ext 1 or Vicki@nokillarc.org",

As he exits his kennel, Dawson\u2019s animated demeanor can\u2019t help but bring a smile to your face; he yearns to get out and about. On leash, Dawson just needs a little while to get into the groove but, in no time, he settles in. Once in a rhythm, Dawson meets dogs well. Still a young pup, Dawson\u2019s forever family should continue his leash training and socialization. Because he has so much to offer and responds well to correction, Dawson\u2019s enthusiasm may overwhelm other dogs. With his humans, Dawson can\u2019t resist a good petting \u2013 start giving this boy a rub-down and that tail starts wagging! Dawson can\u2019t wait to meet you, can\u2019t wait to learn with you and can\u2019t wait to grow with you.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

He was rescued from a house out in the country who just let dogs build up too much and never had them spayed or neutered! They had about 42 dogs roaming out there! He is a super happy and friendly dog! He will be a great friend and companion, great for walking or running too!  Gets along great with all the other dogs here too. He is very submissive and I see many of the other dogs picking on him. He needs out!\n\nAdoption fee includes spaying/neutering, shots, micro-chip and heartworm testing.\nPlease contact foster mom Dinesha at 972-896-6313 or email at adbadoptions@yahoo.com.  To see dogs please download an application from our website, www.adifferentbreed.org and email to foster parents address above. We will arrange a meet and greet. Dogs that have been housebroken may need a refresher course or just learn your new routine.  Maybe they used a doggie door or rang a bell to go out.  Please have patience and give them some time!",

And we found out later she was pregnant too! She is a little timid right now and confused with the changes, but is a calm and well behaved dog, kind of sticks to herself but gets along with everyone.\nBeing spayed 12/15/20.\n\nAdoption fee includes spaying/neutering, shots, micro-chip and heartworm testing.\nPlease contact foster mom Dinesha at 972-896-6313 or email at adbadoptions@yahoo.com.  To see dogs please download an application from our website, www.adifferentbreed.org and email to foster parents address above. We will arrange a meet and greet. Dogs that have been housebroken may need a refresher course or just learn your new routine.  Maybe they used a doggie door or rang a bell to go out.  Please have patience and give them some time!",

She is very opinionated and will tell you exactly what she thinks! \n\nIf you play ball with her, she will be your BFF and play for hours. She can be very high energy but will also chill out with you and watch tv. Nova loves to go for walks and car rides. \n\nOur girl needs to be the only dog or pet in her new home. She especially does not do well with small animals and will need a home with a fenced yard. We have exposed her to other dogs of different sizes and she is doing very well. She will walk by other dogs nicely on a leash. \n\nNova has not lived with children and has not been exposed to infants or toddlers with us or her previous home so we will not place her with these families. We will consider families who have GSD experience and dog savvy kids older than 10. All applications with be considered on a case by case basis. \n\nBesides love, Nova needs a job! She is a working line GSD and working is the key word with Nova. She is very smart and picks up new things quickly. Her job can be anything\u2026training, long walks and runs with her person, or playing in the backyard\u2026she loves to be busy and will thrive. \n\nAs we do with all our GSDs, Nova and her trainer will meet with approved adoption applicants. When a matching family is found, the family will meet with her and her trainer to review handling and obedience work prior to taking her home. Once she is settled with his new family, we will schedule follow-up training. Nova and her new family will get free training for her entire life at The K9Edge in Danvers MA. If driving distance is an issue, GSR&RC will help the adopters find an approved trainer.\n\nNova is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and microchipped.\n\nIf you are interested in Nova, please complete our adoption application and submit it to us. The following webpage has our application and explains our adoption process:\nhttps://germanshepherdcenter.org/adopt\n\nSend us your application by any one of the following methods:\n\nBy email: info@germanshepherdrescue.org\nBy fax: 617 249 1555\nBy US Mail: GSR&RC, Inc. PO Box 210 Nahant MA 01908\n\nMeet and greets will not be scheduled unless you have applied and are considered a possible match for her. \n\nPlease consider a donation to help with Nova\u2019s care and training. We accept donations online on our home page:\nhttps://germanshepherdcenter.org/\n\nThank you for your interest in GSR&RC\u2026it\u2019s all about the dogs. Please share!\n",

            "description": "Zara is pretty girl and a great dog who was picked up as a stray. Zara was very frightened at the shelter and didn\u2019t want to be restrained, and was afraid of men. Zara has been in a foster/boarding home for two months now and the family has earned her trust, including the husband https://youtu.be/MtpwBkJD_tQ   Zara is all smiles these days. Her only issue is she does not like to be restrained, but we think with time she will trust her new owner if they stay kind and patient with her. Earn her trust, like her foster did, and of course, peanut butter! Zara is super housetrained and she does not destroy anything. Zara is about 3 years old and weighs about 57 pounds. She tested well with other dogs HOWEVER we have discovered she is VERY protective of food and toys so would be best as an only dog ?. We do stress Zara needs a dog savvy family and most of all a requires a patient owner. She is looking for a family to love her unconditionally. If you are interested in Zara please email Virginia  virginiaz3@gmail.com  When you email please be sure to add your phone number so she can call you back. We highly suggest no small children because of Zara's restraining issue. She tested heartworm negative and is current on her vaccines.\n\nZara has a buddy to play with, with her foster family https://youtu.be/US7NmYUj9D8   Zara is in the red collar but very protective of food and bones which caused an issue so best as an only dog.\n\nLoves to play with rope: https://youtu.be/eThUcmg56CY \n\nLoves to run around in a yard and chase a ball https://youtu.be/12Zt1vfAJko\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

His skills include letting you know when someone is at the door, being an excellent recipient of butt scratches and belly rubs, sitting in the yard watching the world, and giving you lots and lots of kisses, whether you want them or not. He has a long work history of not chewing on things, and being house trained. Oscar can easily put in 9 hours of napping while you are at work, and does not require a crate like those newcomers to the field. He\u2019s got many years experience at the position of being a good dog, and is very good at it. Oscar prefers an adult only work environment please, kids are delightful from a distance but up close can be stressful. He has never worked with cats and while he does not want to limit his employment options we believe that he would chase them with much enthusiasm. Oscar is not really a half-way kind of dog, when he commits, he commits. Oscar has lived with female dogs in the past and with slow introductions has done well playing with a few different dogs. He would likely do well living with a mellow, polite female dog up for the occasional round of chase in the yard. Fair warning \u2013 one of Oscar\u2019s favorite hobbies is monitoring the neighborhood. The appearance of other dogs will be emphatically announced. Oscar is passionate about this hobby which is why, while he does enjoy a stroll now and then, he is not suited for a home where walks are required. We do not want to see Oscar\u2019s hobby become his career. Oscar was placed as a puppy listed as a German Shepherd mix, and on his return 8 years later, we are thinking we might have been a bit off on his breed combo. We are wondering now if he might have some Akita, or maybe some Chow? We\u2019re not sure, but what we can tell you is Oscar is big and fluffy and would make an excellent best friend.\n\nOscar\u2019s adoption fee has been partially sponsored by a friend of Peppertree\n\n\n-----------------\nDue to Massachusetts State Regulations we are unable to adopt to residents of Massachusetts at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience.\n\n** If you are interested in adopting this dog, you must first complete an adoption application at https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/PEP/Dog/. Or visit our site (http://peppertree.org/category/available-for-adoption/) and learn about other Peppertree dogs. *Note: visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

While we can\u2019t be sure of his DNA, we know this boy is an all American mix! \n\nHe is about 3 years old and quite the leg leaner, independent but loves to be near his people. Vito is an energetic boy who is into playing outside and exploring. Throw him a ball and he\u2019ll be your best friend. Vito likes to hunt around for chippies and needs a home without cats. Vito LOVES to play in our fenced yard with a tennis ball, jolly ball, squeaky ball, rope, he\u2019s not picky. \n\nHe does great at \u201ctrade\u201d and is learning basic obedience. This boy will sit all day, eager to please. He does great with handling, baths and nail trimming, since his foster home went slow and earned Vito\u2019s trust. He loves his people and will take as many head/ear scratches as he can get.\n\n He is crate trained, house trained and pretty good on the leash too! Vito is happy to take walks with other dogs and is polite in public. \n\nWhen it comes to play, Vito is a rough and tumble dog and his enthusiasm is too much for children and can also be a bit much for other dogs. \nVito would be quite happy being an only dog, but we can\u2019t rule out him enjoying a playmate that shares his same WWE philosophy. \nBased on his breed and personality, we think a female playmate may work out better than male. \n\nThis boy is a love, looking for the right match to snuggle with and be his forever home.\n\n--\n\nDue to Massachusetts State Regulations we are unable to adopt to residents of Massachusetts at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience.\n\n** If you are interested in adopting this dog, you must first complete an adoption application at https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/PEP/Dog/. Or visit our site (http://peppertree.org/category/available-for-adoption/) and learn about other Peppertree dogs. *Note: visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

            "description": "LEARNING ABOUT LOVE:  1 year old / 37 lbs.\n\nHello! My name is Samine! I was very scared when I came to Mostly Mutts from animal control. However, since being in a foster home & seeing how other dogs trust & interact with people, I\u2019ve started to trust too. I really WANT to trust & love. With the help of my trainers & foster, I am very slowly opening up to the great life that is ahead of me!\n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  I LOVE the other dog in my foster home, I follow her lead & she is helping me to be more confident. We play hard together \u2013 a LOT!  I MUST have another playful dog in my new home. I don\u2019t think a smaller dog would be a good fit since I\u2019m a hard player. So, if you have a dog that matches my energy level & temperament, let\u2019s meet / I should not live with cats or other small animals (bunnies, ferrets, etc.), as I am way too interested in them / Because I am very slow to trust & commotion of children may cause me to bolt in fear, I should not live with children. Gentle, calm teenagers who are familiar with helping a reserved dog build trust may be fine in my new home, but - of course \u2013 let\u2019s meet!\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I have been much slower to trust men, but my foster dad understands that I just need time to trust. I\u2019ll need a man that is willing to be patient with me, take his time, being a strong leader in a quiet, calm manner. In general, I will need a very patient & dog-savvy owner who is willing to put forth the time & effort to build my confidence & show me how wonderful a loving home can be. I recently enjoyed outings with my foster family to an outdoor restaurant & a couple of parks! I met quite a few dogs & people that I liked & was well behaved. The cars driving by fast made me a little nervous, but I stayed calm / My energy level is 6-8 when I am comfortable.  \n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I\u2019m in the Mostly Mutts University training program where building trust in people is #1 on my list. I made great progress while in the Mostly Mutts\u2019 prison foster training program as well as built some confidence & mastered the \u2018sit\u2019, \u2018stay\u2019, \u2018come\u2019, \u2018leave it\u2019, proper leash walking & waiting patiently to go through doors. I also ride very well in the car, although I\u2019m still a bit nervous / In my foster home, I sleep in a crate when my foster family is gone. I love sleeping on a large dog bed in my foster\u2019s bedroom with the other dog in the home. / My potty habits are excellent on a regular schedule. I hit a jingle bell with my nose by the door to let my foster family know when I need to go out to potty. \n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I love going for leash walks, although I am nervous when vehicles drive by. I am still very much a puppy who loves to play. As for toys, the squeakier the better! I love the fenced yard in my foster home & will need a tall, secure fence to keep me safe. I like to counter surf, so I\u2019ll need a bit more help with my house manners / I have likely had negative experiences with men in my past, so any man in my life will need to be very patient while I get to know them as it will take some time. New environments & loud situations take me some time to get used to.  \n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:   I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped & spayed.  I\u2019m on a medication for anxiety, just ask about that. \n\nI am looking for a patient, dog-savvy owner to provide stability and a loving home!  My adoption fee is $299.00. I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

If interested in finding out more about Betzy, please fill out an application first at www.4luckydogs.org to start our process.***\n\nBetzy is a sweet 8 year old female who loves to give kisses and affection. Betzy is well behaved, listens to commands and loves everyone- she especially loves her foster dad. Although Betzy has had a tough life up to this point she is a happy pup with lots of love to give. She has her spunky moments, but Betzy would do best in a home with a laid back lifestyle. Betzy would be happy in a home with an existing laid back/low energy dog or as the only pet, however she would do best in a home without cats.\n\nBetzy's previous owners were unable or unwilling to give Betzy any medical care. Unfortunately she has been heartworm positive for many years, she has arthritis in her back hips and is missing some teeth. Betzy has done well on her slow kill heartworm treatment and we expect her to have a negative heartworm test soon. Her arthritis is managed with over the counter supplements and a $10 medication each month. Her lack of teeth do not slow her down at all and she happily smiles all day.\n\nBetzy's adoption fee is $200 and she comes microchipped, spayed and up to date on all of her shots and vaccines. You can apply for her at www.4luckydogs.org.\n2/1/21 10:04 PM",

He can't wait to get into a home and explore and live his best life! \n\nMr. P has been slowly introduced to a couple female dogs recently and has done well, he just never learned how to be a proper dog and gets a little overwhelmed. We aren't ruling out a home with other dogs so it will be evaluated on a case by case basis! \n\nIf you're interested or have any questions about Mr. P, please email contact@hopeforpetsrescue.com!",

            "description": "Roscoe is a very handsome, dapper hound. He loves to play with his brothers, sister and foster siblings. He tries to be as brave as possible but always approaches new situations with caution. Roscoe loves exploring the outdoors. He is a happy, often goofy, athletic hound. His markings are very distinctive including bright \"pumpkins seeds\" above his sparkling eyes and absolutely adorable freckles. Roscoe is good with other dogs of all ages & sizes (once he gets to know them and is comfortable) and has been introduced to cats. He loves puppies! Kid testing has been very limited due to the pandemic. \n\nRoscoe and his siblings have been together since birth. They were 4.5 months old when taken into rescue. Living in the woods and surviving on their own has made them very shy around strangers. It has taken months of love, patience and understanding to build trust with their foster family. \n\nRoscoe's foster family feels he will adjust best in a home with another dog. A family or individuals experienced with the challenges often faced when adopting a rescue dog. Middle school-High school age kids preferrred. \n\nRoscoe has a tender heart and a sweet soul. But he is a work in progress that will require an extra level of committment. He just needs that special family!\n\nhttps://awo.petstablished.com/pets/public/816346",

He LOVES being cuddled. He needs a sturdy, taller fence, no chain links but who would leave him outside alone anyway. He has a cute, funny bark - he LOVES his humans and would be great with kids too! He would love to be the only pup to get all the attention, and would not do so great at a dog park. He is such a love and can handle being in a crate.",

            "description": "Hello! Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Hurshi James. I believe you can say handsome, outgoing, gentle, and easy going to best describe me. I am an about 3.5 years old and very easy going. My foster parents say I am extremely smart and very protective. My little fosters say \"I am funny\". \n\nMy life has been a bit hard. I was neglected and abused by my previous owner. My foster parents have been working very hard with me so I can trust men again. I am now relaxing and being myself, but only with slow introductions. It hard for me to trust not knowing you are not going to hit me again. Once I got out of the backyard and couldn't find my way home. I found a little human that looked like mine. Her dad was scared and a piece of wood to hit me. I don't understand why? I just wanted to feel safe and my little humans always hold me and want me around. My foster mom found me right away and was so angry at that man. She kept telling him \"He is a Rescued Dog! He got out and just wanted to get back home!. He didn't want to hurt your child! He loves children!\" Then she came up to me and I felt safe again. I am not as small as a Fluffy dog but my heart is full of love for all humans. :-(\n\nMy family is everything to me. I want all of them to be safe. I love all my foster dogs and cat siblings. I am crate trained, but can be left out all night and you will not be mad in the morning. I do not have accidents. My foster dad says I am the best foster when it comes to being housebroken. He loves me. \n\nI love to play fetch, go to the dog park, ride in the car, play with my foster siblings, and fetch my tennis balls. I can run around with the other foster siblings for hours. I am extremely vocal and sometimes people tell me to \"Be quiet please\". I just cannot help my excitement. I want to be in the action and share what I hear with all around. I also like to keep everyone aware of who is approaching. I don't want anyone hurting my human family or 4 legged. \n\nI am excellent on the leash and love to go for walks. My foster mom tells people to allow me time to get to know them before they come up to me to pet me. I am a \"Rescue Dog in Training\" she tells them all the time. LOL She is really good to me. Once I relax and know they are ok....then I cannot get enough bellyrubs and hugs from everyone. I just need time to get to know you better. Not all humans have been good to me. \n\n My ideal family is one that has a 6ft privacy fence to allow me lots of room to play every day. I also need a family that is patient and can understand that time is what I need to show you how awesome I can be. I had a rough life. I need a family that is low to medium traffic around the house. A house full of people in and out wouldn't be a good fit for me. I also need you to understand my need to share everything with you via barking. I will need to have a sibling dog and you cats too. I am used to all of them. I will become their big brother in no time. \n\nI am currently in Houston and will have to remain here. Please enjoy my photo album with all my pictures. Feel free to share with everyone you know. I am really hoping to get adopted soon. I have been working hard and waiting for a while to get the \"Green Light\" my foster mom says to find my furever home. \n\nThat's my story and my name is Hurshi! Are you my dream Humans?\n\nPlease go to www.springbranchrescue.org and complete my adoption application.",

He is an affectionate clown, great with all sorts of people, including children. He works willingly for food, recalls are solid & will stay in a place for a good while. Yogi deserves a family where he is the only dog. Will bark when someone knocks on the door, which is allowed, but then is friendly to greet when guests enter. He needs someone to be clear with their rules and consistent in enforcing those rules. He is happy, pretty confident, and social. As a working breed, Yogi needs an experienced home.

The necessary protocol was done to find the owners however no one came and the finders needed a home for them to go. Thats where we come into play..\n\nCorbin got adopted immediately but not this girl.. why? Because black dogs have a harder time finding homes? Because she os a bully? Because there was a possibility she was pregnant? Or maybe it was because she was HW + but no one would have known that. \n\nShe is one of the most well mannered dogs ever. She is sweet, snuggly, crate trained, likely house broken but may get bored and chew the insides of her bed... she is great with my male dogs..havent yet had her with female dogs as I feel she could be a bit dominating and more of an Alpha than she leads to be seen. \n\nTruly a loving wonderful girl that is just a little over a year. So smart and so teachable. She does like to chase squirrels so likely no cats.\n\nPlease, before contacting us, through Petfinder, make sure you have read this bio in its entirety as the special needs is important.  Also provide a phone number to your inquiry and location. Calls and emails without using the petfinder inquiry will be required to go back and do it.  Thanks it helps to expidite the process.",

            "description": "Byron is such a sweet boy. He is a pit-bull mix, about 2 years old. Byron is on the smaller side, maybe 50 pounds. He will be your best friend and loves to follow his people around the house. Byron is not high energy, though he likes to rough house with his foster brothers. Byron loves chew toys, bones, being fussed over, sitting \u201cshotgun,\u201dsleeping in bed with his people, and of course food. Oddly, apples are one of his favorites. ? He will follow you around hoping to get a chunk and has been caught stealing them off the counter tops. This boy has so much personality! Byron has been in foster care for about six weeks and he has learned so much. His only big challenge is teaching him to take food from your hands gently...he is super excited for treats and can be too rough for kids with food. Byron is potty trained and used to being crated when left home alone. If you would like to meet Byron or have more questions please email us at arrowsheart2012@gmail.com.",

Blue needs to build up his trust with new people, so he would do better in a home that's not too crazy and chaotic.\n\nBlue is SUPER smart and learns quickly. He is treat motivated and LOVES belly scratches. AND he is a great kisser who loves to give sloppy wet ones! This boy is already housebroken and crate trained.\n\nSome things to note about Blue: He will do best in a home with an adopter who is patient and dog savvy, more specifically one that has very few people in the home.\nBlue has a preference for women over men, but can and has bonded with the right male.\n\nBlue does not enjoy the company of other dogs, so he will need to be the only pup in the house. Because of his timidness and fear, he will need to be adopted into a home with no kids as well.\n\nIf you are interested in fostering, please email info@underdogaz.com or visit our site for our application www.underdogaz.com",

            "description": "Wesley is an adorable, snuggly, calm 5-year-old, 50 pound, neutered, Shepherd/Boxer/Terrier mix.\n\nWhat Wesley needs to be happy and successful in his new home:\n\n* Only pet\n* Big yard\n* Daily walks\n* Gentle/positive training\n* Daily medication ($50/month)\n* Annual vet check up and liver panel\n* Established family/homeowners\n* Single story home\n* Calm environment\n* Older children (8+)\n\nWesley's ideal home is in a home with a yard (not suited for an apartment) and no cats. He enjoys a short walk a day, but is reactive to other dogs on leash so his owner will need to continue to work on training with him.  Although he lives with other dogs currently, he has shown to be selective, so might be best as an only dog.  He would be ok with respectful children over 8.\n\n\nPlease email right away if you would like to learn more about this dog......and visit our website www.siarescuers.org to learn more about our rescue group.   Adoption fees range from $150-$350 for dogs.  THE DOGS SHOWN ON THE SITE ARE IN FOSTERCARE - WE DO NOT HAVE A SHELTER TO VISIT.  EMAIL is the best way to reach us.We are a volunteer run, very small organization - so please be patient when waiting for a response, but feel free to check back in if you haven't heard from us in a day or so - thank you so much for considering a rescued pooch!",

Children 12 yrs and older.\n\nTanner is a well behaved 6 yr old (est DOB 2014), 9 lb little guy who lost his home when his owner could no longer care for him.  \n\nHe is shy with new people and warms up quickly once he knows he can trust you..    \n\nTanner has had many changes in his life in a short period so someone with lots of patience is a must.  Once he trusts, he is your loyal little buddy.  \n\nIt was recently learned that Tanner has a 5/6 heart murmur and required a dental which was done November/20.  He was a great patient and did very well.\n\nNo cats as Tanner feels cats are there for him to chase and bark at.\n\nThis little guy can JUMP!  He has managed to find his way on top of the a table several times.  If this is something that won\u2019t bother you, ok!  \n\nTanner is very smart, he loves playing with one toy in particular and can entertain himself for awhile.  He gets excited about his meal times and wants to be a bed buddy too so sleeping on the bed or under the covers with his adopter is a MUST as well.  \n\nOnce Tanner trusts you (which doesn't take long) and is comfortable, he is super cuddly and wants to be right by your side or where he knows where you are.  He would not do well being left alone for long periods of time, no apartments for this guy.  \n\nTanner is a pro at walking on a leash, he is amazing!  He gets along with other dogs but he prefers they are visitors and he can have his new family all to himself.  \n\nOur goal is to find the perfect home that helps Tanner feel special as he was in his first home he was at since he was a puppy.  He wants to be someone\u2019s special boy  and that\u2019s our mission!\n\nAdoption Fee: $375.00",

            "description": "Darius is such a smart boy! He knows how to sit, stay, come and leave it. He is fully crate and house trained. He loves humans of all ages. He enjoys being outside and playing in the yard. He is dog friendly but needs slow introductions to male dogs. He is one chill, easy going dude. He loves his 2 legged kiddos and the other dogs in his foster home. He is crate trained, and very good on a leash. Ultimately, Darius is a snuggly couch potato who just wants to please his \"person\".\n\nDarius came from South Texas. He had wandered up into the finder's property. He was incredibly malnourished and had a breeder's tattoo on his thigh. He had fresh bite marks all over his face and lips. Friendly and starving they knew he had to be saved. They posted him as lost and no one came forward. The finder reached out to DogRRR and we jumped to the rescue. He is about 2 with heart of a puppy. He just wants love. \n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

Marcie is still timid with strangers but when she knows you she is so endearing and very playful.  Marcie needs a doggie companion to help her transition and to feel confident.  She loves all dogs. It is unknown how she is with cats.  She is mostly housetrained with occasional accidents.  She needs to be crated when unattended.  She is petite and her weight will probably never exceed 30 pounds.   She is a retriever mix with a beautiful red coat and is nine months old.  No young children but older ones are fine. \n\nSpayed\nVaccinated\nMicrochipped\nOn heartworm preventative",

He loves his toys and to play fetch and tug of war. He can be sometimes be stingy with food and toys, but easily responds to correction and really wants to please. Oliver has a heart condition that will require (inexpensive) daily medication, but that doesn\u2019t stop his fun-loving attitude or playful spirit!\n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee. Some dogs may still require completion of these services due to current age, size, breed and/or health. All vet services must be done at the vet clinic used by Once Upon a Tail Rescue.",

Orchid came to us from Saudi Arabia, where she was found as a stray. She has had a bit of a rough start to life and has been working hard during her time at \u201cschool\u201d - she is doing great and is ready to find her forever home. Orchid would do well in a home with another balanced dog. \n\nOrchid loves being around other dogs. She thrives in an environment where she can be surrounded by her friends and burn off some energy. Sometimes her energy results in an inability to focus, so proper exercise and mental stimulation are key to her success.\n\nOrchid is not used to being around people and although her comfort level is increasing, she probably will not be the dog to snuggle up with her people. She does not show any aggression towards people or other dogs (she will occasionally give a warning growl). She has been working hard to learn her manners and has made a lot of progress, but this will probably be an ongoing challenge for her. She is learning \u201cstay\u201d, \u201clie down\u201d, \u201cwait\u201d, \u201cdrop it\u201d and how to walk on a leash. She has been spayed, microchipped, and is up to date on vaccines.\n\nOrchid is hoping for a forever home that has some open space for her to burn her energy, preferably with other dogs to keep her company. She has her paws crossed for an understanding family who will know that she has a lot to give, even if she isn\u2019t great at showing her affection.",

            "description": "Ducky says I'm super duper cute just like baby Yoda and looking for a wonderful family to call my forever. I'm super well behaved and have minor special needs. I love other dogs and dog friendly cats. I would do best with a backyard and a family who can let me in and out often to balance my energy and special nose breathing. I can sit, lay down, place, crate trained. He loves to snuggle up and He is a children's craniofacial ambassador. Check out his Instagram @mredducky and We cant wait to find this super sweet boy his forever family!\n\nMeet Dallas Dog DUCKY!\n\nDucky is a special needs doggo due to contracting distemper as a puppy which caused long term effects on this sweet boy. This could have been easily prevented if Ducky's owners had gotten him fully vaccinated. Because of their irresponsibility, Ducky will always have difficulty maintaining balance and will be at a higher risk of having seizures. He also MUST have yearly dental care as his teeth do not have enamel.\n\nDespite his medical needs, Ducky is the sweetest soul. He loves every living thing especially cats! Any cats in Ducky's life must be cool with a dog who wants to play. Ducky could use some help with his manners as he gets very excited to play with other dogs and when greeting people. Families with young kiddos will not be ideal for Ducky but a confident, non-reactive dog companion would be wonderful for him. This awesome guy needs a home with a fenced yard and very few stairs. He is a higher energy dog but due to the shape of his snout he should not be allowed to over exert himself and is considered a \"flat nose dog when it comes to heat precautions. Ducky's forever must also keep an eye out that his tongue is not getting too dry.\n\nDucky is very special to his foster and to our rescue. Serious and experienced applicants only will be considered. Please email for more information. adopt@dallasdogrrr.org",

She was recently rescued from the Lancaster Shelter when she had been brought in as a stray. Despite all this, she is extremely good-natured and just wants to love and be loved. Babe is around two years old and weighs 55 lbs. She is micro-chipped and has all her shots.\n\nBabe gets along well with other dogs and is being fostered with a small dog. She loves people and generally wants to be around them. She rides well in the car and walks on a loose leash, although she does need a little training to keep her focused. She is also house-broken and is currently being crate-trained. Overall, she wants to learn and needs someone to give her some basic training.\n\nIf you can give Babe the time and attention that she needs, please contact Jack at Jackleslie2004@yahoo.com\n\nThese dogs are looking for homes through private parties in the Los Angeles CA area.

She is a total sweetheart. She is mellow and usually quiet, Molly does get very vocal when her foster gets home from work. She has ignored cats and chickens and tolerates her canine foster-siblings and will usually just find a quieter place to relax when they get too loud for her liking. If they bump her or are in her face too much, she gives a sharp \"momma dog\" bark and they back off. At the vet she wants to say \"hi\" to everyone, human and canine. She approaches other dogs with a relaxed posture and wagging tail. She may have had a rough life in the past but she has kept a loving, gentle personality. 1/29/21 7:32 PM",

After a short time, she will be right at home with you and your family.  Freya is a smart girl and rarely needs to be told anything twice.  She is cute, funny, and cuddly.  Freya is an active girl who loves playing with other puppies, and she would love to have a furry brother or sister in her new home.  She would also love to be adopted with her sister, Faye, since they are already best friends.   Her adoption fee of $275 includes her spay, shots, and microchip.",

She weighs 43 lbs and is very playful with toys and with other dogs.  Faye is a very smart girl who quickly learned how to \"sit,\"wait\" (for her food), how to go up and down stairs, and is currently working on leash training and making excellent progress with her housebreaking.  Faye is shy at first but if you give her some space for about 18 hours, and let her come to you when she knows she can trust you, she will be your new BFF and your little shadow.  She would love to have a furry brother or sister in her new home, or to be adopted with her sister/BFF Freya.  Her adoption fee of $275 includes her spay, shots, and microchip.",

Squiggy is typical of the kind of wonderful dog we have available! We always have 15-20 Pyrs looking for furever homes, and we welcome those interested in adopting a Pyr to read our policies and fill out an application at carolinapyrrescue.com. This application is generic and to come meet the Pyrs. Those who find their match can fill out the adoption contract once they meet the right dog. We will have updated profiles featured under the OUR PYRS tab at carolinapyrrescue.com, but as our volunteers rebuild our webpage, other volunteers are continuing to place dogs, and welcome those who want to adopt to fill out an application. The miracle of rescue is that the right dog is at the rescue for the right people at the right time!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSquiggy came to us through a shelter partner. \n\nHe is about two years old. He is fully vaccinated and heartworm negative and will be neutered soon. \n\nHe might be a mix as he has single dew claws. He also has unique and stunning markings \u2013 and massive paws!\n\nSquiggy is sweet and playful. We suspect that he\u2019s never been in a house, and while he\u2019s learning how to walk on leash and have good manners in rescue, he will thrive with dog experienced owners who know how to set good ground rules and provide positive reinforcement of desired behaviors. \n\nHe would be a great match with a playful large female dog. No other males! \n\nSquiggy is cat-aggressive. Out of an abundance of caution, we will not place him in a home with small dogs, rabbits, or any other smaller animal. \n\nHe would be a wonderful match for a family with children but perhaps is best suited to older ones\n\nLike all Pyrs, Squiggy needs a solid and securely fenced yard\n. \nThose interested in adopting a Pyr should read our policies and fill out an application to meet the Pyrs at carolinapyrrescue.com. \n",

This young Australian Shepherd cross beagle  girl is roughly 2 yrs old and came into rescue with her pups - which most have been adopted with the exception of one little girl named Rye whom is also on Petfinder. Beagle mama is a sweet athletic little dog willing to stand her own and has all beagle attitude with Aussie blue merle coloring and blue brown eyes.  She will be spayed, vaccinated shortly, and microchipped.  She is looking for her furever home where she can play and be active.  She has been good with all adult humans here and has been around small people as well.  She will need some basic skills and obedience training but is definitely a happy athletic little girl.  A fenced yard is a must for this girl and caution when introducing her to other dogs as she can be bossy.  If you like the beagle attitude and voice and also like the Aussie coloring Beagle Mama is for you!",

I am looking for a lady whom needs a secure dependable companion.  As I am that guy!  I haven't been around children so I would prefer to keep it that way.  I am particular with other dogs on whom I will allow to be friend.  I am devoted , walk easy on a leash, completely house, crate, and kennel trained.  I would like a fenced yard so I can run around as I do here at NWMNAR in the playground.  I am enjoying toys and safe dog chews.  I was on the heavy side when I first came here and have got myself back into shape and am fit as a fiddle.  I am looking for a home where I can feel safe and loved and would prefer it be with a woman.  I take a little more time with the men but it could work if you are patient with me.  Here's hoping you will check me out and perhaps find a place in your heart to make me your furever man!  Available for adoption through an approved application .",

She is around 3 years old and came to us sadly after her owner passed away.  We don't know a whole lot about this precious girl.  However, we do see that Diamond has the rare trait of being able to curl her tongue!   So cute!  Diamond reportedly lived with kids for a short time but we are unsure of their ages.   Diamond has become fond of being in the presence of other pups.  She just seems to come alive and really enjoy their company!  Diamond's favorite past time is playing ball!  It must be the lab in her.  \n\nDiamond is on maintenance medication for skin allergies and thyroid issues.   \n\nDiamond's ideal home would be one with a physical fence and an active family to take her for walks and on the adventures that she longs to enjoy!   Some kiddos would be nice too!\n\nUPDATE: Diamond is at Greenlin Pet Resort for training.  She is excelling in her program!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Diamond, please visit our website, www.crcpa.org, and complete an application.",

She is a very sweet and obedient girl and really really minds her manners. She is a great houseguest. Ramona walks well on a leash and follows directions very well. Right now she is very lonely in her foster home as they are trying to keep her away from the cats and she just wants to hang out and lay around. Her energy level is low but she does like to go on walks and car rides.\nIf you choose this girl you will will choosing a very loyal and loving companion who will be your best buddy and follow you around. She does not have any bad habits such as chewing or digging, she really thinks she is a lap dog. She 50 lbs approximately 1 year young and very playful.\nShe is completely medically vetted with everything she needs, you will only need to give her monthly heartworm and flea/tick preventative and plenty of love.\nEven though she loves attention and likes other and tries to play with them I'm not sure she like smaller dogs, she may see them as a cat but she is forever trying to play with the other dogs.\nRamona would make a great family pet. I will to get a video of her and more pictures of her smiling. She is calm and mellow and not a barker.\nWould you give this girl a good home, she so deserves it. She does smile and acts happy bouncing around the house but everytime I get the camera she is curious about it and her face losing its smile. Her dark chocolate color is beautiful and her white chest sets it to be beautiful.\nTransport across the country is available.\nThank you for looking and considering her.\nADOPTION FEE & APPLICATION REQUIRED\n\nRoxy's K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our dogs are raised in foster homes. Each dog comes spay/neutered (fixed), rabies shots appropriate for their age, and dewormed twice. The dogs are up to date on vaccinations according to their age at the time of adoption. They are microchipped, heartworm tested and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventative. ALL OF THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE ADOPTION FEE.\nMedical records will come with each dog at the time of adoption.\nOur organization is run by volunteers/foster parents, please be patient to give us time to respond to your emails and/or phone calls. We will reply to you. Thank you.",

DOB 12-21-19), female, 30 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped. Raven is in the process of starting her life over so she is very nervous after arriving to Vermont. She is incredibly fearful and will need time to decompress and learn to trust people. Her Adoption availability is currently on hold until she is ready! Right now she is too much of a flight risk that we do not yet want to move her from her foster home. We believe she will need another dog but we will need time to assess her personality once she comes out of her shell. Stay tuned for more information as Raven is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Raven please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

Hulk arrived to Vermont super duper happy! He is absolutely adorable and is a big strong boy who LOVES people! The shelter staff in SC said \"Hulk is a cool guy! He was very affectionate towards us in the kennel. He was also excited to meet the other dogs in the kennel and did well with all of them. He also was great with the tester dog, and was very excited to play with her! He did pull quite a bit on the leash. He did NOT like the cats.\". Hulk's ideal home would be active, have Intermediate experience to keep Hulk on the right track and be a responsible breed representative, no cats, the rest is TBD! Stay tuned for more information as Hulk is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Hulk please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

Diamond was rescued from a sad situation where she was kept in a backyard.  Animal Friends Society saved her and she is now the happiest girl. \n\nDiamond is now heartworm negative after having tested positive when rescued and being treated for heartworms.  She loves walks and car rides.  Diamond is great with older children and loves everyone she meets. She is dog selective, and would do best with a male dog or as an only dog where she can soak up all of her family's attention.\n\n\nDiamond is spayed, microchipped, heartworm negative, and has been started on a monthly flea and heartworm preventative..\n\nDiamond's adoption fee is $200.00.   Animal Friends Society is a small 501(c)(3) group that uses adoption fees to care for the current and future fosters in our care and to continue our mission of spaying and neutering.\n\nFor more information on Diamond, or to fill out an application, please visit animalfriendssociety@hotmail.com.",

            "description": "Abba is a 3 year old pit bull mix who is expected to be around 60 lbs. She is housetrained (winning!) and loves to hang out with her foster people! She loves to go for walks and runs. Her life goals include going on her first ever hike and getting pets from as many humans as she can. \n\nThough Abba is dog friendly, she has an awkward intoruduction style and a bit of a rough play style that could be interpreted as aggressive behavior by some dogs. She can be successfully introduced to tolerant dogs in a matter of only a few minutes, but she is not a good fit for a home with another dog who could become defensive. She would thrive in a home with a friendly, easy-going dog to play with and learn some manners from!\n\nAdoption fee is $300 and includes spay/neuter, microchip, fecal/deworming, vaccines and prevention up to date. Ohio residents only.\n\nSTS is a foster-based and volunteer-run rescue. We do not have a physical location or set hours for you to meet dogs, and it does take time to answer each inquiry. All dogs are in foster homes and once an application is approved and a home visit is completed you will be able to schedule meet and greets with available dogs. We encourage interested individuals to get approved prior to searching as it helps expedite the process. A Petfinder inquiry is not a substitute for an application. For detailed information about our adoption process, including fees, please visit our website at http://www.stopthesuffering.org.",

IF YOU MEET OUR CRITERIA FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE PROFILE TO COMPLETE OUR APPLICATION. THANK YOU!\n\nMeet Alice!\n\nAlice is a sweet, adorable, sensitive girl. She is 2.5 years old. \n\nAlice can get very nervous and spooky around loud or sudden noises and does best in a calm home and neighborhood. Alice would love to be a couch potato and homebody ;-). She is not meant to be a party girl!\n\nAlice is also a bit bow-legged and doesn\u2019t have the best knees so she isn\u2019t going to be a marathoner or snow-shoeing companion. Just a sweet, fun, loyal housemate.\n\nWe did a DNA test so we know Alice is a Staffie/Boxer/GSD mix. Even though she isn't great at meeting new dogs while on leash, she absolutely LOVES other dogs and thrives with a confident and playful dog companion so we will only place her in a home with a securely fenced yard and a dog friend.\n\nAdoption Process: We are not first come first served. Indigo Rescue focuses on finding good matches between dogs and families to ensure life long adoptions. We deliver all dogs to their new homes. All of our dogs are in foster homes. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting one of our dogs, please use the following link and complete our Adoption Application. You can either scan your completed application and email it to us at: info@indigorescue.org, or you can fax it to us at: 888-502-7660.\nThe link is not live, so you will need to copy and paste it into your browser: https://storage.googleapis.com/gator-users/user-680788/documents/d1742bff02e44c2ea25649cb45df5103/Pet%20Application%20Form%20December%202020.pdf\nIf the dog you're interested in seems compatible with your lifestyle we'll set up a time for you to meet the dog privately.\nPLEASE NOTE: Indigo Rescue only adopts to homes within 30 miles of Beaverton because our volunteers deliver all of our dogs to their adoptive homes. We work very hard to create a family of our Indigo Rescue adopters because we want to be close enough to help in case there are any problems. We want everyone to be happy and successful!\n\n**ALL of our dogs, puppies, cats, kittens and rabbits come vaccined to their age, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting and saving a life.",

Since then, she has been in an in-home program, decompressing, relaxing, and learning the fine points again of living in a home.\n\nThese days Sassy is a happy girl! Her trainers are so proud of her and so are we <3\n\nNow it's time for her to take that next step on the road of her brand new life, and find a fantastic forever home! At about 9 years old, she is so deserving of a home where she can enjoy her golden years and love and be loved!\n\nSassy is cautious for a few minutes when she meets new people. She takes her cues from the humans - if you are confident, she will be your best friend within a few minutes :)\n\nSassy needs to be an only pet and to live in an adult home.\n\nShe is house trained, crate trained, walks well on a leash, and knows her basic - and some advanced - commands.\n\nSassy is a playful girl who absolutely loves toys! She would love a fenced yard where she can enjoy the outdoors in nice weather and play with her toys and her family.\n\nShe loves car rides and is well behaved in the car.\n\nSassy is somewhat more comfortable with women. It takes her a bit longer to warm up to men than to women.\n\nWe are looking for a family for Sassy with experience with the breed, who will work with her and Jenn and Trey to make sure the transition is a smooth one. Having spent most of her life in a shelter, she now has welcomed all of the comforts of living in a home. We are determined to set this girl up for success <3\n\nTo adopt please fill out the form at our website - https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application",

When she first came to us, because of past trauma and abuse, she was extremely fearful and aggressive. She was scared to death of anyone coming near her. It was so hard to see such a tiny animal so afraid of everything and everyone. But after about ten days of giving her space and hand feeding her cheese (her favorite), one day she simply bounded into her foster's lap, looked up with her big brown eyes and trusted.  Ever since that day, she has been a little best friend and delightful. She is perfectly potty-trained (not one accident!), loves to lie in the sunshine outside and has just started to really explore.  She doesn't walk on a leash yet, but could learn. She's an absolute doll and despite what must have been a very traumatic past, she just wants to love and be loved. It may take time for her to warm up to her forever home, but  she is absolutely worth the wait. She'd be the perfect dog for a single person or couple who can give her the love and attention she craves and deserves. A home without other pets or children is a must.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

Bernard will happily sleep and snuggle all day... but gets super excited any time he hears the sweet jingle of his leash as you get ready to go for a walk. Of which he needs many! He is currently 40 lbs overweight (and on a diet) after a year and some depression in the shelter. Bernard would love a fitness buddy as well as a person to rub down his big ole belly nightly.

Callie was tethered to a tall metal pole and she could only walk in endless circles around that pole. During violent thunder storms, Callie frequently faced death by electrocution from lightning strikes. She often was forced to drink dirty water from a 5-gallon bucket coated with slime. During the Texas summers where temperatures can exceed 100 degrees, Callie was at daily risk for heat stroke. In the winter months, Callie's malnourished body would shiver as she laid on the cold and damp dirt.\nDespite her heartbreaking history, Callie thrived in her new foster home where she shown kindness for the first time in her life. She loves human companionship and interacts nicely with the other dogs in her foster home. Not surprisingly, Callie is a little needy and wants nothing more than to be near a human. Accordingly, she will need to be kenneled when left alone at home.\nPlease understand you are committing to providing a good home for her entire life (up to 15+ years or more.)\n\nYou must be committed to housebreaking, age-appropriate enrichment and exercise, leash training, grooming needs, and positive socialization.\n\nHer adoption fee is $300. This includes her spay surgery, rabies vaccination, Nobivac Canine 1-DAPP vaccination, Nobivac Intra-Trac 3 vaccination, Drontal Plus, Tri-Heart Plus Chewable Tablet, IDEXX SNAP 4Dx Plus Test, 24PetWatch microchip, leash and collar, and a trial offer for 24PetWatch Pet Insurance.\n\nPlease be aware that puppies and small breed dogs do get adopted quickly so interested parties are encouraged to apply online at www.saspca.org.\n\nPlease ensure your application is complete before submitting.

She is actually very active and loves to run around and play with toys. \n She is a little shy with new people but is super friendly after just a few short minutes and is the sweetest girl. She loves adventures, like going on long walks and hikes. She can be a bit clingy with her person and doesn't like being left alone so prefers to be with a a family that is home often or can take her with them on some fun outdoor adventures. She is house trained but needs some work on crate training. She is good with other dogs and does best with dogs that are calm and her size or smaller, even though she is good with other dogs she is not playful so would prefer to be the only dog or have a dog companion that is calm and easy going just like she is.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

Al is a 5 year old 58lb, Black Mouth Curr mix. Al wants to PARTY!  Running through the tall grass, roaming the beach, going for a jog, hitting all the camp sites, that\u2019s his thing. He\u2019s a grab the leash, jump in the car and hit the rode kinda guy. Al didn\u2019t have much training in his formative years, but since he has been in class he is an A student. Smart, treat motivated and eager to please, once properly trained he\u2019s going to be a great off leash dog. Al isn\u2019t overly found of other male dogs and probably is a little too high energy for young children, but if you are in need of a best friend and ever present wingman, he\u2019s your guy! Al's history with cats is unknown. Al is looking for an active family or a family who can keep him busy as he is a high energy dog.  Al is currently in Portland, OR and is available for meet & greets!\n\nIf interested in adopting AL please fill out an adoption application on our website:\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Please note that a bite waiver will be required as part of Mario's adoption. \n\n9 year old, 22 lb Mario the Magnificent is ready, willing and able to challenge you to a masterful marathon. Test yourself against his prowess in swimming or his speed in the hundred-yard dash. \n\nBut when his athletic endeavors are over for the day, he becomes the perfect couch potato and wants nothing more than to cuddle at your side.\nMario needs to devote himself to his people and that would best be either a single person or a dog-savvy couple who are able to deal with guarding issues. In his past life, he attached to one person in a couple and got a bit snarly with the other person. In his current foster home, that has not been an issue.\n\nYour life will never be dull with Mario. He is unusually smart (hasn\u2019t been tested for genius yet, but pretty close) and takes correction well. He loves to perform and is an active boy, except for when he\u2019s cozying up with you.\n\nMario can become stressed easily, so we don\u2019t want a home with children, in fact, no one younger than 18. Likewise, although he has been around other dogs for short periods, we want him in a home where he is the only (spoiled) dog. Dog parks? No way. He\u2019s also not a candidate for walks in busy areas with lots of people and other dogs. Therefore, besides your lap, Mario\u2019s piece of heaven is in a nice, single-family home with a fenced-in backyard in either a suburban or rural location. Even better would be one with a pool or close to swimmable water.\n\nThis active boy is totally house trained but he is not a great fan of crates. He is not fond of being locked in but if you leave the door open, he willingly finds it a secure place to curl up for a nap.\n\nIn addition to diving and swimming, Mario also loves to play fetch with his ball or a frisbee. In fact, he will fetch as long as you throw! The bottom line is that Mario is just a big mush who just wants to be someone\u2019s best buddy. \n\nHis foster Mom says it best:\n\u201cMario is a really good boy. He may take a while to adjust to a new home, but with slow, careful adjustment, he is worth every second of it!\u201d\n\nIf Mario\u2019s craving for one on one adventure is in tune with your idea of fun, submit a S.N.O.R.T. adoption application today! Adoption Fee: $300\n\nPlease submit an adoption application on our website!  https://www.snortrescue.org/adoption-process/adoption-application/\n\nNote: All dogs in SNORT's care are fostered in private homes by  dedicated volunteers. SNORT's adoption fee includes appropriate veterinary care, all necessary vaccines, and a spay/neuter.

            "description": "Meet Jess! Her heart is so happy when she is getting belly rubs and butt scratches. She is easy to please just spending time with her humans, but is also happy to entertain herself playing with toys. Jess has the most personality! She loves to play fetch with herself and likes to chew on Kong toys. Jess will make a great couch potato and will still get the zoomies sometimes. Jess is one our favorites because no matter what, she is happy to see you and always smiling. She was brought to us in rough condition, and she clearly has been bred over and over. Now is her time! Let's find her a furever family. Jess would prefer a home with no other animals so she can keep her humans all to herself.Please call the shelter at (706) 795-2868 to schedule a meet and greet.\n\nMadison Oglethorpe Animal Shelter is a non-profit shelter serving over 720 square miles. We are open intake, meaning we can not turn away animals from either county we serve. Our shelter intakes double or triple it's capacity every month so it is essential we place animals quickly into adoptive homes. Since so many animals enter the shelter we often don't have enough volunteers to write an individual bio for each. Please feel free to call the shelter Wednesday-Sunday to inquire about the animal you are interested in. 706-795-2868.\n\nViewing and adoption hours at our shelter are Wednesday through Sunday from 12 PM to 5 PM. \nAll adoption fees include age-appropriate vaccinations, flea treatment, deworming, and spay or neuter, microchip, and adoption packet. \nFees:\nDogs over 4 months old: $100\nPuppies under 4 months: $125. \nCats and Kittens are $75 ($65 without microchip). \n\nFor your convenience you can fill out an adoption application for any of our current residents at www.moaspets.com. Join us on Facebook at\nhttps://www.facebook.com/moaspets. It's a great way to stay up to the minute on the furry 4 legged friends we have looking for a loving forever home. \nWe are located at:\n1888 Colbert Danielsville Rd \nDanielsville, GA 30633 \n706-795-2868\n\nNOTE: Our adoptions are first come first served, simply filling out an application does not mean the animal will be held for you, you must come meet the animal in person in order to be considered for adoption.\nIf you rent you must bring your lease or a letter from your landlord stating you may adopt.",

Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application. The minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100%25 tax deductible. Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems. Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

            "description": "This dog is new to the rescue. More information will be posted as it becomes available.\nPuppies are a life-long commitment. They need time, training, vet care and healthy feeding to become good canine citizens. Don't even think of adopting a puppy unless you intend to invest the time and money and commitment required, and you can expect to lose a few good shoes along the way!\n\nIf you are interested in me, please contact us at puppies@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application.\n\nThe minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100% tax deductible.\n\nPrior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.\n\nOur adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.\n\nWe show our dogs at adoption events every weekend! Please click on events at Events to see where we'll be next! Coastal German Shepherd Rescue of Southern California is a non-profit 501(c%293 public charity dedicated to finding loving homes for abandoned German Shepherds. Your tax deductible donations go to support these very deserving animals. Coastal was formed to serve communities in the counties of San Diego, Orange, Los Angeles and the Inland Empire. We are committed to finding loving permanent homes for the orphaned dogs in our care. Coastal is an all volunteer, no-kill, 501 (c%29 3 non profit organization.",

My human dad passed away & then my best friend, my fur brother Duke, just went to meet him in heaven. I\u2019m currently in boarding in Lafayette, they are my family, & love me so much. They want me to have a happy ending this Christmas.\n\nI\u2019m a 3 Year Old Staffordshire Terrier Mix. My favorite things are to play with toys, play outside, take walks & ride shotgun every chance I get. My wish is to go to Diva Training School one day to brush up on my manners & talents or learn from my foster or family.  I\u2019m full of unconditional love & forever big kisses to give! I can be an only child or I would love another fur sibling to make memories with.\n\nIf you can open your heart & home to me, please let Santa know. I\u2019ve been spayed. I\u2019m on Heartworm Prevention.\n\nMy Christmas Wish,\nBlue\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nFor additional information see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

She is definitely mixed with some sort of terrier as her hair is a bit scruffy but the breeds are unknown. She is so friendly and outgoing and loves everyone. She loves to play with other dogs.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Before applying to adopt, please know the adoption fee is currently higher than usual ($850 CAD). Due to the pandemic, we have been needing to fly people to Turkey and back to get the dogs, and flights+hotels are around $2000. Normally we have \"flight volunteers\" which are people who just happen to be flying from Turkey to Toronto and they bring the dogs with them, but because of the pandemic, there are no volunteers and therefore we have to send people to Turkey.\nFor this reason, the adoption fee is $850 CAD and it includes vetting and flight.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please do not email to ask if they are available. Rather, fill out an application here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

            "description": "Bella: 2 yrs old; Weight: 55 lbs; Activity Level: Active Companion; Breed: Border Collie/Lab; Coat: Short w Fur in Hind Quarters.  Bella is a super fun, confident, loving pup just 2 yrs old and she has wiped her past struggles and unknown life experiences away!! She was abandoned by her owner during a roommate struggle. This sweet, vibrant girl didn't know what walks in neighborhoods or trails were like-she only knew what she was given. When a dog comes jn my rescue i work on the whole dogs health, physical and teaching new life skills, this is exactly what Bella needed and we did include a little whole foods in her diet and joint support which has been a success.  She was not the confident dog she is today and knows her human partner is her coach.  Bella would do well with a dog savvy active leash partner who will continue all the progress she has achieved, who can enjoy introducing her to people and other dogs. She has good sense of which dogs are safe for her but not ready for a dog park-more meet on walks develop play dates. Bella loves people and study children 10 and up as she loves to run and show you her speed with well-mannered kisses and hugs. She will climb in your lap too and be there for your hours of need. A big yard (6 foot secure fence) is a must as well as not being alone for an 8 hour work day it\u2019s too quiet come home and go for a game of fetch (use 2 balls please!) or a cool dog walker or work from home. She isn't the needy type to pester you-she knows humans have jobs and so do dogs. Speaking of jobs did i mention how Bella loves tricks and crates well perfect for dog classes to enrich her mind! On the leash Bella can get excited and I use positive reinforcement to redirect her, something her new coach will do for her too.  Bella is fully vaccinated, microchipped to rescue and her new partner, and on Advantage Multi. To apply for Bella you can share your lifestyle with us and if we think it\u2019s a match we will send you an application and proceed with meets and home visits. She won\u2019t travel without you if you\u2019re from out of state, we would look forward to meeting you on a visit to TX. The adoption donation is $225 for Bella\n\n",

Due to the pandemic, we have been needing to fly people to Turkey and back to get the dogs, and flights+hotels are around $2000. Normally we have \"flight volunteers\" which are people who just happen to be flying from Turkey to Toronto and they bring the dogs with them, but because of the pandemic, there are no volunteers and therefore we have to send people to Turkey.\nFor this reason, the adoption fee is $850 CAD and it includes vetting and flight.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please do not email to ask if they are available.

One of their sisters went to a new home last year. They are all such sweet and loving girls. They are easygoing and get along with other dogs and all people. They are about 55 pounds each. They do not need to be adopted together.\n\nIMPORTANT: Before applying to adopt, please know the adoption fee is currently higher than usual ($850 CAD). Due to the pandemic, we have been needing to fly people to Turkey and back to get the dogs, and flights+hotels are around $2000. Normally we have \"flight volunteers\" which are people who just happen to be flying from Turkey to Toronto and they bring the dogs with them, but because of the pandemic, there are no volunteers and therefore we have to send people to Turkey.\nFor this reason, the adoption fee is $850 CAD and it includes vetting and flight.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please do not email to ask if they are available. Rather, fill out an application here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

He is great with staff, a people loving pooch. Tavior loves long walks, enjoys milk bones and back scratches. Tavior also loves chasing ball, food (he is not a picky eater), chicken, duck, beef, pork, lamb, you name it he'll eat it. Tavior would do great as the only dog in the house hold. At the time it is unknown if Tavior is house/crate trained. Dogs are NOT tested with children and cats; his behavior towards children and cats is unknown. He is available for adoption/rescue as of 12/23/19. If you are interested in Tavior, please contact the Delano Animal Shelter or inquire about Tavior below on Petfinder for more information. If this is your dog, contact the shelter as soon as possible.\nIf you have any questions, make sure to give us a call to Phone Number: (661)720-2244\n-photos are taken by Delano Animal Shelter staff",

He is great with people, loves our attention, and our snacks. Blue loves hiking trails, enjoys sun bathing, long naps, and the feeling of grass in-between his toes. Blue minds well on a leash, he's a total love bug and loves to please. Blue would do great as the only dog in the house hold. At the time it is unknown if Blue is house/crate trained. Dogs are NOT tested with children and cats; his behavior towards children and cats is unknown. He is available for adoption/rescue as of 09/09/19. If you are interested in Blue, please contact the Delano Animal Shelter or inquire about Blue below on Petfinder for more information.\nIf you have any questions, make sure to give us a call to Phone Number: (661)720-2244\n-photos are taken by Delano Animal Shelter staff",

            "description": "Bambam is a very nice, big boy. He loves attention from people. He's calm and well-mannered. He is good with other dogs. He was a stray in Turkey. his breeds are unknown; the listed breeds are just a guess.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Before applying to adopt, please know the adoption fee is currently higher than usual ($850 CAD). Due to the pandemic, we have been needing to fly people to Turkey and back to get the dogs, and flights+hotels are around $2000. Normally we have \"flight volunteers\" which are people who just happen to be flying from Turkey to Toronto and they bring the dogs with them, but because of the pandemic, there are no volunteers and therefore we have to send people to Turkey.\nFor this reason, the adoption fee is $850 CAD and it includes vetting and flight.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please do not email to ask if they are available. Rather, fill out an application here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form\n",

However, he ultimately wants to please and has the potential to be a loving, loyal companion. He knows how to sit and shake, and is willing to learn much more if you have a treat in your hand. He is easily one of the staff favorites due to his sweet personality. \n\nGideon would do best as an outside dog, as he has a tendency to mark. He would also do best with an experienced adopter who understands his independent and intelligent personality.

No matter whether the route is an easy green circle around the neighborhood, or a more treacherous black diamond around a park he takes on the challenge with gusto. Rosco also loves romping around for a play session with his person chasing a ball or blazing the trail by running a lap around the backyard.\n\nAfter time outside Rosco will gladly snuggle up to his human on the couch. The fresh air and warm comfort lulls him to sleep. His favorite pillow is his human's lap where he will wait patiently for head scratches as he dreams of days ahead.\n\nRosco will need to be the sole shedder on your hill. He would thrive as an only pet in the home. Rosco finds the extra layers of interaction in an apartment building confining; therefore, he is not a candidate for apartment living. Rosco feels an unshakable chill when with men, presumably due to previous interactions prior to coming into rescue, so he is looking for a special lady to spend days outside and snuggled together on the couch.\n\nRosco is a sweet young pup looking for a home filled with play, and above all snuggles. Rosco knows that the forecast for the perfect forever home looks great this winter and can't wait to see what the season brings.\n\nDUE TO A GENEROUS SPONSOR ROSCO'S ADOPTION FEE IS ONLY $200.",

Charlie\u2019s only issue is that he does not like other dogs so he will need to go to a home with no other pets.  \n\n\n\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION FROM OUR WEBSITE: www.hoperescues.com.

            "description": "Bobbie is a handsome young German Shepherd estimated around 1 year of age. We do not know Bobbie's history prior to arriving at the shelter however we know he is eager to find a loving home of his own.\n\nBobbie an active and energetic young guy who believes his laughter inducing antics makes up for his lack of manners. Bobbie can be unsure when meeting new people and at times will be vocal but once he warms up he is a goofy, sweet guy. He acts like he isn't sure if new people are going to hurt him or not which paired with him being a bit shy of hands makes us think he perhaps didn't have the most kind start in life. Bobbie is working hard to overcome this though and is going to do great with more structured socialization. Bobbie can be rambunctious and loves to roughhouse with those he knows but is still learning exactly what manners and boundaries are. He is going to require patience and guidance as he figures out exactly where he fits into a household. Bobbie has not be around children and is not currently recommended for a home with children under 13 years of age.\n\nBobbie is currently living with other Shepherds and Shepherd mixes in his foster home and learning how to navigate social settings well. Bobbie struggles to regulate himself when the energy is high in a play group and was not doing great with the other dogs when he first arrived. He has since settled in and is learning how to play - particularly with the dogs a bit smaller than him like a Dutch Shepherd mix named Fredrick. Bobbie can be a very rough and tumble sort of player though which many of the other dogs don't appreciate. He has learned to respect those dogs when they set that boundary though and is overall doing well meeting new dogs. Bobbie is not currently recommended for a home with cats or dogs under 45 lbs.\n\nBobbie is a typical Shepherd 'teenager' and is looking for a home that will give him the guidance and socialization he needs as well as plenty of exercise and love. If you're the home for Bobbie please email Tierhavenrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application or visit Tierhaven.rescuegroups.org for FAQs",

Precious is one of those dogs that appreciates a relaxing time; when you take her on walks she looks up at you with a silly, happy go lucky look that will instantly put you in a good mood.  She is a goofball too and enjoys playing with toys and other dogs.  If you already have a dog in the home a meet and greet will be set up to determine if the dogs are a good match. Although she does well with fun easy going dogs, Precious will need a cat free home as she finds cats a bit too interesting.\nPrecious has had enough of shelter life and is starting to have a hard time. \nWe would love to get her into a wonderful loving home looking for the cutest little girl to spoil rotten.  Sometimes Precious can be a little reserved when meeting new people but she warms up very quickly and is a really sweet dog. Because of her initial reserved nature, we do recommend any children in her forever home are respectful teens.\nPrecious is 2 years old and weighs only 48 pounds - she is a CUTE little gal and seriously will make a great addition to some lucky family's pack!",

This poor boy had lived his entire life outside, weighed down by very heavy chains. His owners did not have much and Moose went without food on several occasions, surviving the best he could off of the table scraps they brought him. Moose had a hard life and needs to learn how to simply \"be a dog. He needs to learn some manners and appropriate reactions; we've been working with him and he's been doing great with us. He is high energy and can get over stimulated at times. He needs time and patience (and understanding) and someone committed to working with him and providing positive training. Because of his high energy, we recommend a home with children over the age of 10 and at this time be an only pet.\nHe is young, only 3-years-old, 52 pounds, and neutered. He is heartworm positive and has started his treatment, will is covered by Pet Search.\nPet Search was able to rescue this sweetheart with the help of United Paws Rescue and Pilots and Paws days before he was scheduled of euthanization ... his life matters and he deserves a chance for a better life.\nApplications are available at petsearchpa.org.",

She comes from a high kill shelter in Monroe, GA but she is safe now in a foster home in Moyock, NC. Because Irene has such a gentle and sweet personality, she will make an excellent addition to any home. She's very calm and easy going and gets along well with other dogs. \nShe's very thin now and will need to gain some weight but she is a perfect lady in the house and does well in a crate (not that she needs one). \nIf you would enjoy a wonderful, mellow companion, then you may want to consider Irene. She loves her humans and will make a great family addition.  Please email littlepups2017@gmail.com or message the Second Chance Habitat Facebook page to get more information about Irene or set up a meet and greet.",

Cobalt approximately ten months old and weighs approximately 35 pounds. He is great with other dogs and kids and is house and crate trained. He will need lots of toys because he is likes to chew. A fenced yard is required and another dog is preferred. He loves to play fetch and follow his foster mom around every where she goes. Cobalt sleeps cuddled up next to his foster mom every night.

He enjoys sitting on laps and being petted. He will at times play with other dogs but can also be a bit grumpy towards them especially during feeding time or nap time. He likes exploring the backyard and sunbathing. He enjoys his walks, a lot! Will pull on the leash but settles after the first 10 minutes. He is crate trained and potty trained except for the occasional marking. Because he can't see well, he can be snappish when scared so kids 14 and older are best. Like a lot of chihuahuas, Benchi can be quite the barker and will go outside and bark at what seems to be nothing. He enjoys cows' ears and lots of treats. He has gotten much better at taking his daily eye drops but can growl at times when he's had enough. Overall, he is sweet but best suited in a quiet home with no children or other dogs.",

            "description": "Meet Paige! She is a black and white Terrier mix and around 2 years old. She is a sweet girl who is timid with newcomers and takes time to warm up to people. She gets along with other dogs and is fostered with cat. We think Paige would do best in a home with another dog to help her gain confidence and learn from. She is housetrained in her current foster home. This cuddly girl wants nothing more than to be up in your lap. She will need a quieter family that can continue to work on her socialization. If you are interested in meeting Paige, your first step would be to submit an adoption application on our website. If you are already approved with an adoption coach or have adopted from us before, reach out to your coach for the next steps. This information is as up to date and accurate as possible for the dog in its current environment. All dogs and puppies will need time and training to adjust to their new surroundings and to learn the rules of their new home. If you are interested in meeting one of our dogs, the first step is to complete the Adoption Form on our website at www.labsandmore.org and take some time to review our adoption process. Your adoption includes the spay or neuter, current vaccinations, microchip, and other services provided while in our care. The safety and health of our puppies is priority one, so we only allow approved applicants to meet and handle puppies. Please understand everything we do is for the dogs and conducted by our kind and generous volunteers. We rely solely on donations, and we do not profit from a dog's adoption. Labs and More is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that operates on donations and time dedicated to this cause by volunteers. Your adoption will save the life of future dogs in need. Labs and More makes no guarantees regarding the behavior, breed, or age of the dogs in our care. Although we strive to provide necessary medical care to dogs in our care, we cannot predict future or current medical needs whether they were symptomatic or not at the time of adoption.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life! Dogs + Love = Family",

Morty is the one on the left on the photo. These pups were dumped a a high kill shelter. They get along great with everyone and love other dogs. These two are bonded and need to be adopted together.  Ferdy will try to play with the feral cats and has climbed a 4 foot fence to get out to play with the cats.  She would do great at agility!  Morty will play but love to be with his human.  \n  \nThey are up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, on monthly heartworm preventative, monthly flea/tick preventative.  They will be scheduled spayed and neutered prior to adoption.\n\nEmail aplaceforallrescue@yahoo.com if you are interested in adopting  these beautiful babies!!!!",

HE waited his turn to be adopted into what he thought was his new forever home in February 2020. That new home did not turn out to be Sam's forever home.. His adopters had a new human baby and Sam did not do well with the newbie so the family decided to return him to the shelter. They did say Sam was house trained and he got along well with the small dogs in the home. The other dog his size  did not get along with Sam. Sam has been a perfect guest during his stay in the shelter. Sam is current on vaccines, neutered, heartworm tested negative and micro-chipped. You will find Sam waiting in run 850 and his ID# is 624664.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

            "description": "Female Rottweiler\n\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nApproximate date of birth: 03/08/2016\n\nCurrent weight: 79 lbs Ideal weight: 77 lbs - 80 lbs\n\nChildren: No \n\nDogs: Very selective + dogs over 35 lbs \n\nCats: No\n\n\nRita came to TVR as an owner surrender. Sadly, due to her owner's serious medical issues, she was not able to care for Rita anymore. Rita is very sweet and loving with her familiar friends but can be standoffish with strangers and acquaintances. Rita needs to go to a home with owners who have lots of experience with Rotties and who are able to manage her size and strength.\n\nOccasionally she likes to play with other dogs but can be selective about her dog friends. Rita exhibits some resource-guarding behavior-especially with toys-so if she is considering a home with another dog, at least one onsite introduction will be required before she goes home.\n\nRita is overweight, but has lost a good amount of weight while in our care already. She has had some knee and leg discomfort that will need to be monitored and currently require some pain management. At TVR we will continue working on her weight loss goals while she's in our care and would love to see those efforts continued in her new home. We believe she will continue to feel better and better once she loses all of the excess weight, possibly eliminating the pain meds until she is older. \nMaintaining a healthy weight will be important for her longterm well-being and quality of life. We ask that Rita's adopters work with her on low impact exercises (I.e. daily walks) to get the excess weight off and to help her maintain a healthy weight.\n\nDespite all of the sadness and turmoil Rita has endured over the last many months and recently being returned, she is still happy to see her friends. She often shows off her classic Rottie booty wiggle once she knows and trusts you. In the right home and environment we know Rita will make someone very happy!\n\nDoes Ms. Rita sound like the one for you?",

Once she gets to know you, she loves to give hugs and show affection. Lily really enjoys playing fetch (her ball toy is her favorite) and taking nice long walks with her favorite people.\n\nIn August 2020, Lily was returned to TVR due to a couple of incidents displaying aggression towards the family's other dog. Based on this incident, we think Lily would make a great companion for an experienced dog owner. Lily has also been working with the amazing trainer who comes out to TVR to work with several of our dogs. Lily has been doing wonderfully in those training sessions. We are all honestly surprised that this incident even occurred in the previous home.\n\nLily is sad that she didn't get along with her previous doggie roommate, but she doesn't let being returned get her down. Before she was adopted and after her return, Lily continues to play great with quite a few of the dogs at our rescue. Playtime with her best doggie friends is one of her favorite things to do. She absolutely loves rolling around in our fields with them, just having the best time!",

Please complete an adopter profile to set up your meet and greet: http://coastalpetrescue.org/adopt/profile\n\nAdoption Fees:\nKittens: $60, Cats (1 year plus): $50, Puppies: $250, Adult Canines (1 to 6 years): $200, Seniors (7 years plus): $100 (unless otherwise specified). Adoption fees are not a tax-deductible donation as allowed by IRS regulations. Adoption fees help to offset the cost of the pet's care incurred by Coastal Pet Rescue, which are generally 2 to 3 times the adoption fee amount.\nSome special circumstances may change the fee; see pet's listing for actual adoption fee.\n\nAll Coastal Pet Rescue pets are current on shots, microchipped* and spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters are responsible for any shots that may be due after adoption (particularly for kittens and puppies that must have three rounds of shots to be protected).\n\nMicrochip:\nCPR has implanted a microchip as part of the adoption process and the chip is included in the adoption fee. However, some chip companies require a registration fee varying from $9.99 to $19.99. The registration fees are the responsibility of the adopter and are NOT included in the CPR adoption fee. Adopters may add this cost to their adoption fee to have CPR register the chip on their behalf.\n\n30 Days Pet Insurance: \nAs a Petfinder member, all adopters are entitled to a free 30 day insurance policy through PetFirst. Coastal Pet Rescue is not responsible for this policy. Adopters must call PetFirst\u2019s toll-free number 855-710-7387 to activate the coverage. If adopters fail to call, the policy will not be activated.\n",

            "description": "Kora von Korbach is a beautiful 2 year old German Shepherd mix. This dark beauty has a sweet and mellow personality with a medium energy level. She's a loving girl who craves attention from her people, being petted and calm, quiet environments. She'd love to keep you company and just hang out with you in the house (she's housebroken too!). Kora thinks that getting treats is fun and she takes them so gently from your hand, which makes training easy. Going for a walk is her favorite and she shows it with her waggy tail. She would make a great walking companion as she is easy on leash, only pulling a bit if she gets interested in something. She gets along with other mellow dogs, avoiding the high-energy ones, tho we think she may prefer being the only dog in the home. Kora does fine in playgroups that have calm and sweet dogs. She is satisfied to come in and explore around, doesn't mind the other dogs and mostly does her own thing. When she decides it\u2019s time for a break, she lies down and relaxes. She is a \u201cno\u201d for cats.  Gorgeous Kora is ready to bring joy and calm to her forever home.\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

            "description": "Babalu is a courtesy post for Harbor Shelter. If you are interested in fostering or adopting him, please contact Angela at the info below:\nAngela Springer \nHarbor Shelter Volunteer \n310-717-2442\nharborvolunteers@yahoo.com \n\nFrom Babalu himself: I've been waiting for over one year to go home. People may look at my age (11 years) and think I just want to be a couch potato.  That's not the case.  In the yard, I'm very playful.  I love to gallop to my humans & am not shy about asking for pets. I'm definitely  a \"foodie\" and I am very treat motivated. I love to play ball.\n\nOne of my favorite human friends at the shelter said this about me. \"He is by far one of our best residents. He keeps his cubby clean.  He knows to retreat into the cubby during clean time, and he's quiet in the kennel.\"\n\nBabalu is a great dog, but needs an experienced handler who is patient with decompression and time. He was anxious in his first two foster homes, but when he was brought back to the shelter, he seemed happy and ate right away. \n \nTemperament:  Easy going and happy fellow. \n\nDog Experience:  On walks to the park, Babalu seems curious about other dogs & didn't show aggression.  He was dog tested at Harbor . On first dog test, Babalu ran away from very active dog. On 2nd test, he ignored the other dog & did his own thing \n\nLeash Skills: Babalu pulls, but takes direction well. \n\nRecommended Home:  Babalu would be best in a home where someone is  home full time. From his foster experiences, an experienced, confident, & patient owner who can help him with his separation anxiety is recommended. \n\nTraining:  He is a candidate for a 6 week training program called PawsforLife K9.  If you bring me home you will get his training for FREE!",

If you find a dog you want to meet in person, please go to www.secondchancedogrescue.org and complete an application. We will make every attempt to process all applications within 3 business days of receipt.\n\n// // Madeline (Maddie) and Tinkie are a bonded pair of super-cute pooches who finish each other's sentences and look out for each other. They are never very far apart and need a home together. Maddie is the Pomeranian and Tinkie is the Maltese-Poodle mix, and they are both approximately 10 yrs old. Maddie is about 9lbs, and Tinkie is about 13 lbs. Maddie is the talker and does typical \"pom chatter\", especially for meals. Tinkie is the soft-coated snuggler that will melt your heart. Both will nap in their beds if you are busy working, although they really want to be in the same room with you. They love short walks, exploring the back yard, and time on the couch for movie nights. They are good in the car and good on a leash. They are pee-pad trained, but they are not quite ready for carpet privileges, so if you have easy clean floors it will be a win-win for everyone. In their foster home, they sleep together without complaint in the family room.\n\nThe girls were surrendered to us needing long overdue vet care and professional grooming. Tinkie has gotten her dental and lost several teeth, so she is feeling so so much better and is eating with gusto again. Maddie's pre-dental bloodwork came back for Cushings, so she is settling into her new daily medication before she gets her dental and rabies. Maddie's coat and flaky skin issues are being addressed by regular professional grooming, good nutrition, and by treating the Cushings. Maddie's current \"lion\" haircut is a good compromise while we wait for her skin and coat to recover. Both girls get wet food for now, but can be moved to a small bites quality kibble that addresses their skin and coat once both dentals are done and their mouths heal.

If you find a dog you want to meet in person, please go to www.secondchancedogrescue.org and complete an application. We will make every attempt to process all applications within 3 business days of receipt.\n\n// // Madeline (Maddie) and Tinkie are a bonded pair of super-cute pooches who finish each other's sentences and look out for each other. They are never very far apart and need a home together. Maddie is the Pomeranian and Tinkie is the Maltese-Poodle mix, and they are both approximately 10 years old. Maddie is about 9lbs, and Tinkie is about 13 lbs. Maddie is the talker and does typical \"pom chatter\", especially for meals. Tinkie is the soft-coated snuggler that will melt your heart. Both will nap in their beds if you are busy working, although they really want to be in the same room with you. They love short walks, exploring the back yard, and time on the couch for movie nights. They are good in the car and good on a leash. They are pee-pad trained, but they are not quite ready for carpet privileges. In their foster home, they sleep together without complaint in the family room.\n\nThe girls were surrendered to us needing long overdue vet care and professional grooming. Tinkie recently had a dental and she is feeling so much better. Maddie's pre-dental blood-work came back for Cushings so she is settling into her new daily medication before she gets her dental and Rabies. Maddie's coat and flaky skin is being addressed by regular professional grooming, good nutrition, and by treating the Cushings. Although we have not seen them around kids and cats, Maddie and Tinkie have sweet and gentle temperaments that suggest they would be good with everyone in your family.\n\nMadeline and Tinkie are loving, cuddly, come-to-life stuffies who are looking for devoted owners who will pamper and love on them. The girls are spayed and microchipped, and are being brought up to date on shots and are receiving vetting. Madeline and Tinkie's joint adoption fee is $400.\n\nAll Second Chance Dog Rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, are up to date on vaccines and have microchips prior to adoption.\n\nAdoption fees vary depending on age of dog.

Does well with slow introductions where he can make the first move. He gets along well with dogs that give him space and are not too high energy.\nObservations with Cats: Cornelius is interested in cats, but he does not chase or play with them.\nObservations with Kids: Cornelius is a little scared by the energy of children, so we are looking for a home without young children.\nHouse Training Progress: No recent accidents\nCrate Training Progress: Untested. Really loves his bed -- spends much of his day there and sleeps well through the night.\nLocation: DC area foster\nRescued From: Roane County, WV\nAdditional Information: Cornelius is the kind of buddy who enjoys very leisurely walks and doesnt mind you hitting the snooze button a few times in the morning. He is a gentleman at home doesnt bark, beg or chew on anything. He knows the words \"sit\" and \"down\" and \"crossing\", which is useful while out on walks. Cornelius loves spending time with his people, enjoys pets, and is very loyal: so much so that he gets nervous when he is left home alone. He would do best in a home where his people are retired or will work from home even after the pandemic. Cornelius is having a little trouble adjusting to city life and all of its bustle, so he needs a home in a quiet suburb with a fenced back yard. He is gaining confidence outside, though unexpected noises and unfamiliar people can startle him. He recovers pretty quickly and will continue on his merry way. Slow, calm introductions will warm Cornelius up to new people and get his tail wagging. Cheese and other treats are the great motivators for those walks later in the day. Cornelius is a sweet, low-key dog who will stand by you and love you without limits. Apply today to meet this heart of gold fella.\n** Cornelius is available for a senior adoption fee of $250.\n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application. If the animal has \"HAS APPLICATION\" listed, they are still available to receive additional applications but also may be in the process of being adopted soon.

We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

            "description": "Hi, Sparkie here. I am an 8 year old sprightly girl. One of my favorite things to do is to go on walks.  I love them so much that I will drag my feet when I know we are about to head back. I may be 8 years old, but that doesn\u2019t slow me down. I can do a sturdy 4 block walk without getting too tired. I\u2019m potty trained but being \u201cmiddle aged\u201d I sometimes have to go potty at night. If I have a doggy door I can take care of business, but if not, I\u2019ve also been trained to use potty pads. I am very smart and pick up on words and commands quickly. \n\nI was at Contra Costa Animal Services prior to being rescued by MAR, and I\u2019m now in a loving foster home. My foster mom thinks I may have never had a bed of my very own and only ever lived outside prior to coming to her. I am a very silly and goofy girl. I do live with another dog, but I like monogamous relationships, so I might prefer to be the queen of the castle. I\u2019m a playful girl and I absolutely love it when my foster mom gets on the floor and plays with me. I like it here very much, but my mom needs to find me a loving family of my own so she can continue to save more dogs. I would really love to have my very own forever family. I\u2019m a loyal girl, and I will love and protect you always. If you are interested in knowing more about me or meeting me in person please contact Martina Animal Rescue at martinaanimalrescue@yahoo.com.\n\nLove Sparkie ???\n\nApplication, home check and adoption fee required.",

She's another girl from a rural area who is adjusting to a new kind of life. While she appears shy and a bit timid at first, once she gets comfortable she will quietly come up to you, and she can bond quickly with her chosen person once in a home.  Annabella is looking for a calm adult home that gives her time to adjust and also sets the rules. She is housebroken and enjoys a game of fetch. She enjoys her walks around the rescue, staying close to her handler as she can be a little shy in new environments. She meets other dogs with a wagging tail, but pushy dogs tend to intimidate her. In playgroups she's a curious girl as she wants to know what everyone is doing.  If you\u2019re looking for a sweet and devoted companion, Annabella would like to meet you.\nNo cats for Annabella!\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

We were told that Rollo is housebroken and knows some basic commands, and he previously lived with a smaller dog. He does well on walks but needs some work on his leash manners. Rollo gets along great with other dogs. He meets them well and seems to relax when freely exploring the play yard. It may take Rollo a minute to settle into a new environment but, once he relaxes, he turns into a major sweetie. Come meet Rollo today!\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website! So, check in and log on often! \n\nWestside thanks you for looking at our amazing dogs and for choosing to save an animal's life through rescue. \n\nDon't forget to visit your local animal shelter...the source of many of our dogs.\n \n\nwww.sheprescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WGSRescue\n\n",

            "description": "Hey new family it\u2019s me Fireball!  I\u2019m a 50lb 1 year old neutered male.  The vet I saw in Oklahoma thought I might be a pointer mix.  Everyone I saw thought I was handsome no matter what I am.  \n\nWhile I\u2019m waiting to rescue my forever family, I\u2019ve been hanging out with my foster family who loves me like their own. \n\nI\u2019ve been going to work with my foster mom and meeting all the customers. They love saying hi to me and my foster brothers.  I\u2019ve met new people almost every day but so far none of them needed to be rescued.  Sometimes I feel a little shy meeting men at first but we make friends quickly.  One of my new Wisconsin guy friends said he thinks I look like a Charlie.  I\u2019ll answer to that too especially if it comes along with play time or snuggles.  \n\nWhen my foster brothers and I are outside, I love to wrestle and run around.  When we play inside, I share toys and bones politely.   When it\u2019s time to relax, I love cuddles, especially with my foster mom at bed time. \n\nEven though I\u2019m all about being with my furry foster brothers, I prefer personal space while I\u2019m eating.  I like to be able to eat out of the bowl by myself instead of sharing it the same time.  \n\nI would love a brother or sister at my forever home if possible so they can show me around. My foster brothers have been showing me the ropes and helping me feel comfortable.\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve learned potty goes outside, how to hop in the car, where my yard is, to come, to stay, and to go in my kennel all by myself.  I am gaining comfort in my kennel yet but I admit a nice tasty bone and some treats make it much easier to be in there.  I am working on sit and keeping four on the floor. I love my family so much I get so excited to be with them\nand meet their friends, I forget to plant my butt on the floor or to stand still.  What can I say, I\u2019m a lover, and just in time to be your Valentine!\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website-?www.luckymuttsrescue.org?and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.\n We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions. \n Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  \nSubmitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  \nOnce you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.  \n Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. \nPlease be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  \nSubmitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen. We receive several applications for each dog. \nOur adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.  \n Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will\nbe in active status for a period of six months. \n We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  \nShould you see a dog that interests you,please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

Whether it's going for a hike, a run or a swim -- yes, this boy is part sea creature -- Ozzie loves the great outdoors!  However, he's a wizard at escaping a yard, readily leaping over tall fences, so he needs a situation where he can be engaged and active, but not take off on his own to explore the world.  Ozzie is a wonderfully happy, outgoing and social boy who has been good with everyone he meets. He previously lived in a home with a child. He's housebroken and knows some commands.  Give him some pets or belly rubs to see his goofy side come out \u2013 Ozzie is quite the comedian!  He\u2019s always ready for outings and does well around other dogs on leash (and was fine with a smaller dog in a previous home).  Ozzie so loves being outside that he\u2019ll be eager to see the blue skies when you meet him.  If  he pulls at his leash at first, a quick correction will set this boy in line.  Ozzie is the king of his playgroups \u2013 he would love to find a furry playmate in his forever home.\n\nFor the most current information on this dog, or any of Westside's other incredibly wonderful dogs (and occasional cat) , please visit our website or Facebook page where you can find updated biographies, availability and new photos. So,check in and log on often! \n\nWestside thanks you for looking at our amazing dogs and for choosing to save an animal's life through rescue. \n\nDon't forget to visit your local animal shelter -the source of many of our dogs.\n \nwww.sheprescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WGSRescue\n",

See our adoption proccess.\n*** Adoption Pending***\n\nSPIKE will do anything with and for you as long as he trusts you! Spike knows basic commands, walks nicely, and will let you brush anywhere. Timid at first, he will lean in for pets and will woo, leap, and twirl when he's excited. He is very smart and extremely food motivated, so you can teach him pretty much anything. We have been working on 'sit' and 'wait' to teach him not to push through the door since he doesn't like to be left behind. Spike will play fetch with you, bringing the toy right to your hands sometimes. His favorite past time is sleeping and gnawing on bones. There have been a couple of times that he has guarded a bone (it was a rawhide that had broken off) and a rat that he had caught, but I never worried that he would bite me. He will warn you if he is not comfortable with you getting too close or guarding something (only twice in the time he has been with us), so you have to be able to read his body language and respect his space. Spike has good house manners, although has the potential to be a counter surfer. That said, all he wants to do is be with his people, so he would be perfectly content just laying at your feet and sleeping while you work. He is a playful and mischievous boy, so he definitely needs to be with an active family that knows and understands malamutes well. Spike has been in foster with another large, active dog and is doing really well, so a large play buddy would be a good thing! No cats though or other small furry creatures and in his exuberance Spike might bowl small humans over but is otherwise a very friendly boy!\n\nCheck out Spike's own foster Instagram @spiketakesahikeInterested in sponsoring?

Kimberly enjoys spending time with other dogs in our exercise areas.  \n\nShe is a beautiful Border Collie mix!  She weighs 22 pounds. \n\nAre you that special someone who can give Kimberly the home she dreams of?\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

            "description": "Jana and her sister, Kimberly, arrived at Horse Creek from the animal shelter on July 22, 2020. \n\nShe is very friendly and loves playing with other dogs her size. She loves people and wants so badly to be loved and accepted.  \n\nJana is a Border Collie mix and she weighs 23 pounds. \n\nShe will make a great companion for the loving family who will open their hearts and home to her!\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

            "description": "This sweetheart of a boy is 5 year-old Thor. ? He weighs approximately 65 lbs.  Thor is a happy-go-lucky dog that loves people and is very friendly.  Every morning he gets so excited to see his foster again, that he does a little zoomie dance!  Seeing this will make you want to adopt him on the spot!  This sweet love just wants to be the center of attention and he loves to go up to everyone for pets.  When he wants attention, he will come up to you and put his head under your hand, so that you will pet him.\n\nWhen Thor get super excited, he does like to jump on people, so would do best in a home with older children for now.  Although Thor seems to do best when interacting with large dogs, he should still be the only dog in the home.  Since he can be territorial over his \"person\" (toys not so much), an experienced owner would be best to recognize and correct any resource guarding/marking issues.\n\nThor is currently being crate trained, which we would recommend continuing.  Although he is not destructive by nature, Thor will destroy any container that has/had food (i.e. trash cans, Tupperware).  Thor does not beg for food, but he is an opportunist.  If you leave food unattended for 5 seconds, he will devour it!  \"You snooze you lose\" is his motto!  He knows the command \"sit\" and \"come.\"  His foster is working on \"place,\" which he knows, but will only comply if there is a reward.  Thor\u2019s foster is also working on \"gentle\" for treats.\n \nThor does excellent with baths, medicine of any kind, nail trimming and great in cars.  Short 30 minute walks are perfect for him.\n\n\nPlease help us get Thor into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt loving Thor, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.\n",

Dogs in the PURPLE category are very shy and will need equally patient adopters that have experience in confidence building. Dogs in the PURPLE category may also benefit from having another confident canine in the home.\n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information. Thank you for your interest.\n\nAdoption Hours: Wednesday\u2013Monday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM (Closed Tuesdays)\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024",

She does her business outside and is well mannered in the house. Bonnie loves her people so much that she can have some protective tendencies with new people coming in and out of the home, so an adult-only home is preferred and she'd love someone who can help show her that not everyone is a stranger. \nBonnie really loves two things in life; sticks to chew and people to cuddle with! She will greet you at the door with full-body wiggles and maybe even show you her favorite toy. Life wasn't always so kind to Bonnie and she has walked a long and tough road to get here. She doesn't enjoy the company of other animals, and honestly, we can't blame her after what she's been through- so she's looking for a pet-free home. Don't worry though, she has enough love and wiggles for people to go around! Bonnie's adoption and vet fees have also been sponsored by an anonymous donor",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Jenny Cope (giveadogahome@live.com) for more information about this pet.\n\nGYPSY was saved from a high kill shelter in Texas where dogs have just 3 dogs to be saved and transported to the rescue in Sebec, Maine GYPSY is spayed, core vaccines, rabies, heartworm & tick disease tested negative, de-wormed, monthly preventatives and micro-chipped. She weighs around 44 pounds and is approx 2 years old.\n\nWe have no idea the exact breed of any dogs so it is up to you to look an decide what you feel the breed is and be sure you are familiar and capable to care for that breed or breed mix.\n\nNEEDS TO BE THE ONLY DOG!\n\nGypsy is such a sweet girl who doesn't do too good in the kennel environment, she gets stressed and worked up. She is not good with other dogs so cannot but put in a communal area. Outside of the kennel she is a dream girl. She is happy, fun, very loving and affectionate and gentle. Of course being a rescue she does jump a little but that is just because she wants to get as much attention and love as she can.\n\nA volunteers brings her 9 year old children over to play, socialize and walk the dogs and Gypsy is fantastic with them. The kids can easily walk her on the leash with no worries, she is very responsive and a lot of fun.\n\nGypsy needs a family that doesn't have other dogs and most likely not cats. she is an active girl and so an active family is very important. She needs to be able to run and burn off her energy and hiking, walks and times at the beach or lake would be perfect for her. Training is imperative for any new dog going to a new home, not only for obedience but also for trust and respect. Away from dogs Gypsy is a dream girl for any family with or without kids.\n\nShe has a little quirk in that she will try and play tug with your feet, this is something that she most likely did as a puppy and the people who owned her encouraged this behaviour instead of teaching her no. She is very responsive when told no, but if she thinks it is a game she will continue to grab at your feet. She is not attacking you, she is just playing - it will be very easy with training to teach her that this is not acceptable.\n\nBe sure to check out the rescue website for more pictures and videos.\n\nAll dogs use dog doors to go out and do their business or to enjoy the cool, fresh weather in their dog runs or communal areas. We cannot say if a dog is house-trained, however, we expect families to understand that all dogs need a transition period and accidents could happen and training is most definitely needed.\n\nAll dogs are fed\nRachael Ray Nutrish PEAK Natural Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Western Grasslands Recipe with Bison.\n\nRachael Ray Nutrish Peak Dog Food receives the Dog Food Advisor's second-highest tier rating of 4.5 stars.\n\nGYPSY is available for an adoption fee of US $550.\n\nThis fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of saving all of the dogs we do, the running, upkeep and maintenance of the rescue. Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada. All that is needed to take dogs into Canada is a copy of the adoption contract (receipt) and current rabies for pups over 3 months of age.\n\nDue to Covid restrictions, it is important Canadain families reach out to the border patrol fo rup to date factual information on re-entering Canada.\n\nIf you feel that you have the heart and home to give this precious soul a wonderful life, please go to our website, under the ADOPTION INFO tab, complete, then submit the APPLICATION. Our process takes around 2-4 days, and ensuring your references are aware that we will be calling, could speed up the process. Once you have been approved, we discuss any questions in regards to the dog you are wanting to adopt, then you complete and submit the contract, make payment and then we can work out the pick up / transport arrangements.\n\nPlease do NOT submit an application if you are not looking to take home a new best friend within the next few weeks.\n\nhttps://www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org/forms/form?formid=5838\n\nALL Dogs are LOCATED AT THE RESCUE IN SEBEC, MAINE. We post in various states along the east coast and Canada where we have had lots of successful adoptions to enable more exposure for these beautiful saved souls. Families will need to be prepared to travel to the rescue to meet and take home their new best friend. Sebec is located just outside the towns of Dover-Foxcroft and Milo (approx 8 miles) and approx 45 miles from Bangor. There are also lots of hotels, motels, pet friendly accommodations and wonderful camp-sites for the more adventurous families and what a great way to get to know your new best friend\n.\n\nClick here to watch a video of GYPSY. 2/1/21 8:10 AM",

Due to the volume of interest in our animals and the convenience we offer of applying online for adoption, we are no longer able to reply to messages sent through our Petfinder page. MESSAGES SENT THROUGH PETFINDER WILL GO UNANSWERED. \nCopy and paste this URL link to learn everything you need to know about the adoption process and to fill out the application.\nhttps://www.grandstrandhumanesociety.com/adopt/\n\nRoxy has the most beautiful eyes and a sparkling mahogany coat!! Roxy is a beautiful girl with a lot of love to give. When she is out of her kennel she is happiest snuggled up to a human getting all the affection she deserves. She will even offer you her paw as a request for more petting! Roxy is very strong but walks well on a leash once she\u2019s calmed down from the excitement of getting out for a walk. She loves her toys and is very strong chewer so will need some durable toys to play with! Just check out her video playing in our Puppy Playground. You can see what a fun loving pup she is and what a $10 baby pool can do to make her so happy!\nUnfortunately shelter life has been very stressful for Roxy.  She desperately needs to find a home that will understand that she may have some anxiety. All she needs is the right people to help her to relax, decompress, and learn what it feels like to be part of a family. We know that her person is out there so please share and help us find her her forever home.\nRoxy loves sunbathing. long soaks in the pool,  giving only slightly sloppy puppy kisses and of course her most favorite pastime is snuggling in close while you tell her just how pretty she is!! Roxy prefers not to have to share her home with other animals or young children - she is very much a princess and would like all of your attention alllll of the time please!! \n\nRoxy has NO ADOPTION FEE.",

Everest came to rescue from a family who wanted him to guard livestock but they did not keep him fenced and ignored him. Everest liked to go wandering and visiting all of the neighboring people, farms and dogs as he is a social, friendly boy. Everest liked to chase cows to try and play with them, which was not appreciated. Everest is great with people and even does well with strangers. He would love to be your new best friend. He is a sweet guy, does great with other dogs, is fine with cats, too and also likes kids. Everest is such a nice boy - everybody that meets him just loves him, and so will you. He is smart and learns well so he should really enjoy being able to live inside for a change. He is currently in boarding and just waiting for a home or foster home to go to. Everest would love a family of his own with a fenced in yard and a dog pal to play with!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

This 8 year old was surrendered after being severely attacked by the other dog in the home and required multiple surgeries and over a week of hospitalization he's finally on the mend. He was a sweet family dog but this has been a long and painful ordeal and he is understandably a bit untrusting and defensive but warming up to our staff and enjoying going for short walks as he continues to recover. We are looking for a calmer adult foster or adoptive home where he can be the only pet as he continues to recover physically and emotionally. Please submit an application from www.rbari.org if you can help Bubba. Primary Color: Brindle Age: 8yrs 5mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

She has spent with Jenn Ct and Trey and has done amazing :) - and is now ready to find a totally terrific home.\n\nShe is a pit bull, about 9 years old. Jazzy is a well-mannered girl. She is house trained, crate trained, walks well on a leash, and knows all of her basic commands.\n\nJazzy has done well with certain male dogs but is dog selective and we need her to go to an only-pet home as a result.\n\nShe needs an adult home with people experienced with the breed.\n\nShe is a cuddle-bug, loves car rides, and loves playing outside in the nice weather with her toys.\n\nHer favorite time of all is treat or dinner time!\n\nJazzy likes most people - if she is not a fan of a particular person, she will let you know.\n\nShe will sometimes get excited and jump up. However she takes corrections well.\n\nSo ... if you love blue pit bulls and have experience with the breed - and if you can be a firm leader - then our Jazzy is your girl :)\n\nShe is a wonderful (and absolutely gorgeous) dog who is 1000% deserving of a family who will love her (and spoil her a little bit) forever and ever.\n\nTo adopt (or foster-to-adopt) please fill out the form at our website - https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Bob the very handsome freckled faced Great Pyrenees is a 1 year young guy who is an owner surrender due to no fault of his own. Bob is house trained, walks well on a leash and is crate trained but he isn't trustworthy with free roam of the house yet. He will of course bark to alert, he might dig when bored and still has some puppy chewing but with the right amount of exercise, stimulation and supervision (as all puppies require) Bob will learn daily and he matures. He has been allowed on the furniture, is good in the car and has lived with another dog and cat previously. Bob prefers submissive siblings and more mellow dogs who don't get in his face. He can be a bit shy with new people but he warms up quickly and then loves to be petted. He loves to be with his people, he will come when called, he is sweet, loving and likes to snuggle and sleep at your feet. Need a shadow? Bob is your man!! He will need some patience to help him through his shy phase and he learns to be a bit more confident. Bob loves any kind of toy and chew bones and is more than happy to chew on either!\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Bender and Darling are very bonded. A perfect home for them would be a nice quiet home with a fenced in yard. Bender is leary at first when meeting people where Darling will go right up to people. Bender needs an owner where his leariness is accepted and his owner is able to work with him and reassure all is well.\n\nBender is a sweet boy, and is very gentle and loving with others. He is a bit shy when first meeting people, but warms up quickly. He absolutely loves being outside and playing with other dogs.\n\nDog 4 a Day Update :\n\nWe took Bender and Darling to Lake Eola to participate in the dog for a day program. They did great! They walk great and even better when they are together. They did not demonstrate any aggressive behavior towards dogs or humans and they let other humans pet them. We had a wonderful day and we were able to bring my dog and other two dogs with us and they all got along well.\n\nBender and Darling have become very bonded. They are both a bit shy upon meeting but come around quickly and are very friendly and playful. They both love going to the dog park. They do so well together and we feel that if they were separated, they would be very upset.\n\nDog 4 A Day Update: Bender is such a sweetheart!! He was really well-behaved and mellow all day. We had no problems walking him on the leash. He stayed close to me or went a little ahead to explore most of the time. He was interested in the other dogs at the park and was friendly with all of them. He liked being around children and let them pet him. We went to get food and he was happy to lay down and hang out on the patio with us while we ate. Every time we were in the car he just quietly curled up in the back seat and fell asleep or looked out the window. Overall, he's a very sweet, relaxed dog. If I could have a dog where I lived I would adopt him in a heartbeat! He just needs a loving home!",

            "description": "Meet Winslow! He's a 3 yo, 13lb Jack Russell Terrier Mix. Winslow came into foster care early July knowing he was going to be a \"special case\".  When he was pulled from the shelter he was \"odd eyed\", at the time we didn't know if that meant he just had 2 different colored eyes or if there was something more going on.  Once we had him in foster care and seen by one of our vets it was verified that Winslow was blind and suffered trauma to his right eye and that it needed to be removed.  To date he has had the eye removed and is doing great!  He also has a stunted right front leg that\u2019s congenital that gives him no trouble, he walks, runs and plays on it just fine, from the looks of it you'd never really know there is any wrong just a slight bow, all that is required of that is a daily joint supplement. \n\nWinslow is dog and cat friendly.  Due to some mild resource guarding at times, I would recommend that he be placed in a home with older kids.  Winslow is very social especially with other dogs but not with other excitable, \u201cin your face\u201d dogs.  His ideal home would have a fenced in yard, again the JRT breed and mixes are known for their tendency to run, dig and excitable nature so they cannot be off leash, he loves to sprint around the yard and will look for areas to escape if given the opportunity, you will need to keep an eye on this little Houdini! He loves to go for car rides and loves his daily walks.    \n\nWinslow is potty trained, knows basic commands (come, sit, no, off) but he can also be very stubborn and likes to challenge you so a home that has experience with behavioral issues is preferred. He does not like to be crated, he has shown some mild separation anxiety so he would prefer to be out roaming the house, hanging with his people or sleeping under blankets if you let him, he also loves to snuggle under the covers when its bedtime.  Winslow has come a long way since entering into foster care.  From day one he didn\u2019t know how to play with toys or even properly play with his other foster siblings, it took him 6 weeks even to give kisses but with patience and love he\u2019s come around.  \n\nWinslow has developed into a very sweet and super affectionate little guy looking for the right home to share all the love he has to give, once you earn his trust he will forever be by your side, are you his match?\n",

Speaking of forever, my forever home will need a fully privacy fenced yard, so no apartments for me please. I am too nervous to share my home with human children, but I love cats and other dogs. In fact, I need another dog friend in my home in order to help me settle in. You see, I have missed out on a lot of experiences in my first two years of life, so I need someone committed to helping me explore the world while I get used to new people and places, and learn what it means to enjoy being a dog. Once I trust you, I am a sweet and goofy boy, but I am looking for someone who will be patient with me as we learn that trust together. I do also struggle with separation anxiety at the moment; I am working hard to overcome my fears, but would currently do best in a home where I will be alone very little. If you think we could be a match made in heaven, then fill out that adoption application so we can start working toward our forever. \n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

Zoey came into the shelter as a stray so we have no background on her.  She is spayed, fully vaccinated and is heartworm negative. Estimated DOB March/2019.\n\nThe shelter vet though her missing leg may have been a birth defect and not an amputation but we will likely never know how she ended up being a three legged girl.  But...  SHHHHH don't say it too loudly because Zoey is not aware that she is different from other dogs or is missing a leg.  She is a pistol!  She can run like the wind and is a very energetic pup!\n\nZoey is in the boarding kennel right now and we are looking for either a foster or adoption for her.\n\nShe is very friendly with people, good with other dogs and seems to be good with kitties. She's going to need some work on basic commands and such but she is very smart and very trainable.\n\nPlease email us for more information asdrescue@gmail.com\n\nTransport: **PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**\n\n***If you are within 1,000 miles, we can usually help with transport using volunteer drivers (depending on the route/availability of volunteers).\n\n***If you live farther than 1,000 miles, we can still assist, however, the adopting party will need to drive any mileage over 1,000 miles.  For example, if you live 1200 miles away, you would have to drive 200 miles out.\n\n",

The family that found him kept him for about a week or so. We were informed that he is still a big baby:) He would benefit from a trainer, and we were told he is very smart and eager to learn. He already knows, 'sit' and 'stay.'\nWith his size at 67lbs, he is very strong on a leash. At first meeting him, he is very friendly and loves to give kisses. He still needs some guidance with pottytraining. He is very playful and loves to cuddle. Due to his size and puppy behavior, older children/teens are recommended.\nMax has shown interest in playing with friendly, female dogs, but because of his size, he would need a physically strong companion to keep up with him. He has also showed us that if a door is open, he will run. A fenced in yard is needed for him to safely romp and play in:) New owners should be observant until Max is settled into new surroundings to ensure he does not attempt to get out of yard as he has shown us he can jump a 6 ft fence. Daily walks and time in the yard with his humans is needed. He very much enjoys walking/running:)",

He loves exploring his yard and cuddling with his person. He knows basic commands and appears to be fully housetrained. Bark enjoys going for walks but is drawn to chasing passing cars. Bark is very strong and will need continued training to break him of this habit. Bark loves attention but settles down quickly and is happy just being with his people. He will be happier as the only pet in the home.\n\nBark will need an experienced dog person. \n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A dog's adoption donation is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

I arrived at MCAS in April 2020, I was originally positive for heartworms and was treated for them while I was at MCAS. So, I am a Heartworm Survivor. I am not good with cats or male dogs, but am okay with female dogs. I am suggested for children over the age of 12, as we are unsure how I would do in a home with younger children. If you think I could be a good fit for you and your family come see me! Thanks!\n\nLove,\nRafferty",

I am a very sweet boy and love my people. I need to be the king of my castle as the only animal in the home. I am recommended to go home with older children, due to my size, energy level, and the shelter being unsure of my temperament with young children. Since I was transferred from another shelter, not much is known about my past. So, If you would like to meet my adorable face, please, ask a member of kennel staff to arrange a meet and greet for us!\n\nThanks a bunch,\n Alton",

Gandhi is house-trained and a pleasure to have around. He is playful, but not rough. He is great with his doggie buddies, playing chase and tug-a-war, rolling around and playing kissy-face. He enjoys a good game of fetch with his human buddies as well as long walks. He will even fetch his toys out of the swimming pool. Gandhi also likes to just hang out and get attention or cuddle up while you read or watch TV. He is up to any experience as long as he is with the his people.. Gandhi is a peaceful boy who just wants love to rule his world.",

I'm 15 years old and on hospice but let me tell you, I have more energy and spunk than most pups half my age. My name is Baby Girl2 and I feel and act like a young whipper snapper. I love to explore the yard. I love fall days when the temperature is just perfect. I get so excited when my people come home. I dance and run around all the time. I am a licker and will give you so many kisses. Old age has nothing on me. I just want my own family to snuggle with and love. Come on and give an old girl a chance.\nMeet sweet Baby Girl2. This pretty senior lady was surrendered to a shelter as her owner could no longer keep her. She is fully vetted and is ready to find that place she can call home and live out the rest of her golden years. If interested in adopting this pretty senior girl, please complete an application at CTDR.org.",

He spent 10 days at this year's car show with hundreds of children fawning all over him and was photographed with infants, but he growled at a man when he was sleeping on a sofa (in a foster home where he never should have been allowed on the sofa in the first two days). He's easy but should go to experienced dog owners. He's funny and sweet and loving, but mostly he's just sad being in the kennel. 65 lbs. 5 y/o",

Once he gets to know someone, and is comfortable with that person, his favorite thing is to be right next to that person.  However, it takes him a little while to warm up to someone.  If he is scared, he looks for somewhere to hide, and tries to make himself as small as possible.  KaLeu prefers other dogs to humans. His favorite activity is playing chase with another dog, and his second favorite activity is carrying toys around. KaLeu has a delicate digestive system, which is intolerant to many foods. Thus, he needs to be on a special diet, which is more expensive than regular dog food.  KaLeu is looking for a forever home with someone what will give him lots of love, and keep him close.  Because it takes KaLeu a little while to warm up to someone, he will take time to bond with his new owner.  Thus, he is looking for a forever home within a 50-mile radius of Goleta, CA.  That way, he can visit with his new owner several times to bond with that person, before moving into his forever home.  Adoption fee is $100.  Donations are always welcome.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is London Eira. I am a 34 pound pocket-size Pittie mix. I am house and crate trained, and I walk pretty well on leash too, except sometimes I pull when I'm excited and I'm a strong girl.\n\nAt first I am shy, but once I get to know and trust you, all I want is to be with you and to be loved. I love to be outside in the warm sun. Want to go on a walk? I'm your girl! I love to gaze out the window and dream of being outside. I will even gently move the curtains aside so I can look out. Cuddling is also a good way to spend our time together. I have a tickle spot and if you are lucky enough to find it while we're snuggling, my leg will go up and down so fast!\n\nI would prefer a home where I am your one & only pet so I can have all the love to myself. It's okay if you have children, but I'd prefer they be a bit grown (teens and older).\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

She is playful and learns things quickly, she's also a super\ncuddler. She will actively seek out affection and belly rubs and generally likes to cozy up\nwith you. She's also a bit of a goofball. She will randomly start licking the fireplace with her eyes closed or wiggle around on the ground trying to catch her own tail while wagging it\nhard enough to continuously whack herself in the face with it. It's funny, she'll be off doing\nher own thing and you'll just look over and start laughing at whatever antic she's in the\nmiddle of.\n\nWhile in foster, this pet has interacted with (people): Adults Only\n\nWhile in foster, this pet has interacted with (other pets):\n\u00a0\nHow has your foster dog responded to: new people, children, or other pets?\n\nShe's wary of new people but as she's gotten more comfortable with us, she's also become\nmore trusting of strangers when we tell her they're ok. She actively looks to us to see if they\nare a threat and if she should be afraid, after an introduction and assurance that they won't\nhurt her she will approach them on her own and ask for pets and kisses. She's developed a\nconsiderable amount of trust in the last month of being here\n\nWere there any pets or people in the home with whom your foster dog did not\ninteract?\n\nDescribe your foster dogs typical routine while in your home:\n\nWake up, go outside and run around a bit before breakfast, hang out in the office or on the\ncouch until lunch while keeping an eye out for squirrels in the yard, a walk at lunchtime,\nhang out again until 5 and then will come stare at us and tell us that boring work time is\nover now, longer walk after work, dinner at 6ish, then playtime inside or outside with toys\n(no biting!), then curl up on the couch with you until bedtime. She normally gets a second\nwind of playfulness around 9:30, we play with her inside toys then she'll crash and be ready for bed. She sleeps on the bed with her stuffed thing. If she forgets the stuffed thing, she'll\nrun out and get it and come back to bed with it.\n\nHow would you describe your foster dog's energy level?\n\nGenerally fairly calm with a few peaks of bonkers bananas throughout the day. She'll run\naround outside like a maniac for about 10-15 minutes and then she'll abruptly go inside,\ndrink water and pass out. Prey drive is high and will get her into an agitated state.\n\nWhat kinds of physical and mental exercise have your foster dog received in\nyour care?\n\nwalks, yard play, stuffed kongs, food puzzles, trick training, toy variety, Other: Hide and seek\n\nDid your foster dog show a preference for any of those forms of enrichment?\n\nShe likes all of them. She'll bite if she gets too riled up with toys so hide and seek or trick training is good to mix in to yard play\n\nWhat has your foster dog eaten for meals and treats? Have you found any food\nor treats to be of high value to them? (The standard food offered for SH dogs is\nNutrisource: chicken and rice formula.)\n\nKibble with a spoonful of wet over it. Shows an insensitivity to beef wet food, keep her on\nchicken.\n\nIf your foster dog has been on medication, what has been the most successful\nstrategy for medicating, including administering?\n\nShe's easy, just put it in with her food\n\nHave you noticed anything that caused signs of fear, anxiety, or stress (FAS) in\nyour foster dog? If yes, please describe what may have caused that response.\n\nShe's nervous around people, you have to be intentional about introductions. She doesn't\nlike when one of us leaves the house. If you distract her and she doesn't notice the person\nleave, it's not a big deal. She only whines, she's not destructive and she'll settle down after a\nwhile. The bathroom freaks her out, she does NOT want a bath. We don't take her in there,\nwe bathe her with a hot/cold water connection we have outside for just this purpose and\nshe does fine. If she's following you around the house though, she'll hard stop before going\ninto any bathroom.\n\nWhat training cues (hand signals and/or words) does your foster dog reliably\nperform, if any? Ex: sit, shake, down\n\nSit, Shake, Down, Stay, we're working on a more reliable \"come\"she's 75% in the house, outside with smells and potential prey she's probably at 4% recall.\n\nWhere has your foster dog stayed when left alone? How long have they been\nleft alone?\n\nWe've only left her alone for maybe an hour or two? Ha ha, we don't leave the house much\nnow. She stayed at home and was fine, no destruction though I'm sure she cried for a bit\nafter we left.\n\nWould you consider your foster dog to be fully house-trained? Yes\n\nHow has your foster dog indicated when they need to go out?\n\nShe doesn't really... she's never needed to tell us to take her out, we take her out frequently\nenough for her needs.\n\nShe's good in the car. She will look out the window, or just curl up in a ball and go to sleep.\n\nWhat else have you learned that can help your foster dog succeed? (i.e.\nenvironmental set-up, interactions, routines, overcoming challenges)\n\nHer prey drive is strong, we've put visual barriers over some of our windows as even a\nsquirrel running up a tree 20ft away will have her 100% focus. If an animal gets too close to\nthe window, she will lunge and attack the window. If she gets off leash and sees prey, it's\ngame over. She's 100% into the prey, not you (mouse or horse) so be aware of your\nsurroundings. She bites when she gets over stimulated so do short bursts of play and then\nmix in training play especially around impulse control. Sit/Stay/Wait for treat, etc. If she\nstarts going for ankles or jumps to bite your hand say a firm No Biting or even just Don't\nand she's getting better and remembering to calm it down, reward her with kisses when she\nremembers to not bite. She's getting to the point that she'll come at you with teeth and\ncourse correct with kissing, seeing progress there.\n\n\n\nCha Cha is a 2.5yr old, spayed Cattle dog/Border Collie mix that weighs 44 pounds. She is super cute, perfect size and has the silliest sleeping positions! She came to us as a transfer from a shelter down in Southern WA back in March 2020. She was brought in as a stray and was very shut down and scared at that shelter. She was pretty shut down with us at first too and after a few days of staff working with her, she began to warm up! She has been in a variety of different foster homes where we\u2019ve learned a lot about her during this time. Cha Cha is fear reactive to new people and other dogs. She also has an incredibly high prey drive for small animals such as rabbits, squirrels, birds, cats, etc. She is VERY smart and learns super quick, but needs someone that understands her breed along with able to continue working on her socialization to people. She dog tested fine at her previous shelter with other dogs, but was timid, avoidant and shut down around them. She has done ok with some dogs that she\u2019s met here, but as she\u2019s gotten more comfortable in her foster homes, the more reactive she has become to other dogs on leash, thus we\u2019ve made her needing to be the only dog in the home. We also aren\u2019t conducting dog tests at this time due to covid restrictions, so by default she needs to be the only pet in the home. Cha Cha can also escape out of doorways and some types of fencing, so she will need a secure yard with a fence. In her most recent home, she escaped out a side door and ran across to the neighbor\u2019s home and chased/herded the horses in the pasture for a long time. She loves toys and has an incredible interest/drive in certain types of toys, so training with toys as a motivator is also an option for her! She is very sweet, loving and cuddly when she\u2019s comfy and warms up to you! She loves to be on laps, couches, playing with toys, out exploring and chilling in backyards. She\u2019d make a wonderful dog for someone who lives a bit more rural, has a fenced yard and no other pets. We think she\u2019d best with teens or older kids in the home. Medically, Cha Cha is healthy, but she is an anxious dog, thus she is on some anti-anxiety meds.\n\nTHIS IS A COURTESY LISTING. HUNAH IS NOT PLACING THIS DOG.

She loves to play tug of war and run around the backyard. She just wants to be wherever you are and do whatever you are doing. She loves to cuddle at night and sleep right next to you to keep warm.\n\nWhat does this dog's diet consist of? prescription diet w/d wet and dry food\n\nThis dog's temperament tends to be: Friendly, Playful, Gentle, Affectionate\n\nWhat is this dog's general activity level? Mellow, Fairly Calm\n\nDo you have any additional comments regarding this dog's energy level?\nShe likes to play tug of war and do a run thru the yard. At times she wants to be very affectionate and will put her arms around your neck to hug and then work her way onto your lap. She then goes a little crazy trying to lick your ear or face.\n\nWhat do you like most about this dog?\nI love how she likes to cuddle in bed and how she likes to hug. It's very sweet.\n\nDoes this dog have any favorite toys or games? If so, what are they?\nLoves the rope and the kong jumbler ball that squeaks. She does get excited eating her treats out of the snuffle mat.\n\nIn foster care, this dog lived with: Men, Women, Children\n\nIf children selected, please list the ages: 17 year old\n\nIf dogs selected, please specify the size and breed:\nN/A\n\nDescribe your foster dog's typical day:\nOn weekdays she sleeps in until about 7am then she eats and goes outside to go to the bathroom and sniff around the yard. She then will come in and lay on the bed in my office and nap. Throughout the day I will let her out back and she likes to chase any squirrels and just smell everything. Then she comes back in. I do this with her ALL day. Then\non weekends she'll sleep until about 8-8:30 then I feed her and put her out. And we do the indoor/outdoor all day again. She will play with her toys off and on as well.\n\nDescribe the daily exercise this dog received in foster care:\nRunning in the backyard. I have taken her for a couple of walks and she is VERY strong.\n\nHow does this dog react to other dogs?\nAvoided other animals so not sure\n\nHow does this dog react to cats?\nDidn't see any\n\nHow does this dog react to new people?\nShe gets really excited and jumps on them so if not prepared will knock you over. Usually she will calm down after 5-10 minutes.\n\nHow does this dog react to children?\nOnly had her around my cousin who is 18 months and she was fine. She wanted to lick his face which was a problem but she wasn't aggressive or mean to him. Just had to pay attention so she didn't knock him over since he was smaller than her then she walked by him. She also would try and take his food if she was near him but not in an aggressive way. Just if he dropped some or walked away.\n\nWhat training cues does this dog know? (ex. sit, shake, come)\nShe can sit, shake, come and lay down. If you say do you want a treat she seems to know that as well.\n\nIs this dog fully house-trained? How often do they have mistakes? Do they indicate when they need to go out?\nShe is fully house trained and had no accidents. She can hold it for a long time. She goes out a lot during the day so she has never needed to indicate she needed to go out.\n\nWhere does this dog stay when left alone? How long can they be left alone? Can they be trusted in a house alone?\nI have left her up to 3 hours alone and let her have the whole house. She has not done any damage while alone and when I come home she is sitting on the couch sleeping. She doesn't seem to be stressed out being alone but she always wants to go with you.\n\nHow does this foster dog do in the car?\nShe is good in the car. At first she wants to come in the front but will just sit in the back or lay down pretty quickly.\n\nDoes this foster dog have any naughty habits that need to be worked on? Is there anything you noticed that this dog is afraid of?\nShe does like to hump and lick or nibble your ears. But it's not so bad that you can't get her off of you when you push her away.\n\nList your top 3 favorite things about this dog:\nAffectionate, Loving, Sweet\n\nAudrey is a 3yr 2mos old, spayed Staffy mix! She\u2019s a thick girl and weighs 74 pounds! She is SO loving, wiggly, active, and sweet! She  just recently came back to us after being adopted for almost 11mos. Her owners loved her very much and were sad to give her up. They had a recent lifestyle changed that resulted in her needing to come back to us. Prior to that, we had Audrey for quite a while due to her having extreme shelter stress on campus and not presenting herself well. Thankfully, she was adopted for nearly a year and is a completely different dog now! She has mellowed out quite a bit and has much better leash manners, greeting manners, and just all around more docile. She used to be quite rambunctious and was difficult to handle on leash due to her strength and would just get over excited about everything. Since she\u2019s been back with us, we\u2019ve seen very different behaviors this time. She is still her happy, excited self, but doesn\u2019t get nearly as rambunctious nor have we seen any mouthing or her getting super amped up. When she was with us a year ago, she was highly reactive to other dogs, however, she has had a variety of dog friends on campus. She\u2019s got a history of scuffles though and Audrey doesn\u2019t respond the best to corrections, thus we made her needing to be the only pet in the home. While in her adoptive home, she was also said to be reactive and hyper around other dogs on leash. While with us now, she\u2019s seen dogs on leash and hasn\u2019t been reactive. She has shown excitement, but not aggression. We still have her as needing to be the only pet in the home and preferring a fenced yard, but she could have dog friends in the future with careful intros. She is so sweet, playful, loving and cuddly! She thinks she\u2019s a lap dog sometimes and loves the water too! Audrey would do best with teens or older kids in the home too. Medically, Audrey is overweight and has hypothyroidism. We have been unable to secure a foster home for her, so she is on campus, but is doing well right now. We\u2019d love to get her in foster or an adoptive home! She is on meds for that along with some anti-anxiety meds too.\n\nTHIS IS A COURTESY LISTING. HUNAH IS NOT PLACING THIS DOG. PLEASE CONTACT THE OWNER DIRECTLY.\n\n\n\n",

I would do well in a quieter, low-activity household, where I could have the time to get used to my new home with you. I would also do best in an adult only home.\nAll our animals are available for adoption, but some may not be ready to go home just yet.\nPlease call if you have questions on current status. 707.442.1782\n\nIf you are considering adopting from Sequoia Humane Society, filling out a general applicaiton is the first step.

            "description": "Want a fitness inspo? Here's Bebe!\n\nHey guys! Checkin' out my shred bod? My name is Bebe and I am about 9 months old, female German Shepherd-Husky wonder mix. I have seen a whole lot in my short life and that's how I grew stronger. I was left at a vet at Valle de Guadalupe, at just 3 months old, where I was stuffed in a crate and that was it. For 3 months! My back legs took a huge hit and my muscles gave away completely. When TAP and a local rescue got me out to San Diego, double amputation was determined to be the best option for me. Did that get me down? Hell nawww! Lack of two legs cant extinguish the fire within me! My surgeries are done and I am undergoing physical therapy and swimming that have led to my ripped front legs. Heck, I can race ya when I am on my wheels! A 3 miler is nothing for this girl.\n\nI am a super friendly girl and have become somewhat of a neighborhood fav! When I see my chariot being brought out, I know that it's time for some fun. I start my walks-on-wheels, and I literally stop the traffic because, well, it's me. There is a great chance that I will be one of those Insta-famous athletes, rolling off on her front legs only. With my water-therapy in full progress, it's just a matter of time! Regarding bathroom training, I have incontinence, so I may need help with clean-up. I don't need to be expressed, but wiping up is needed for this lady. When I am chilling in the house, I prefer to have a drag-bag, just to not scratch up my skin. That's only until I am fully mobile on my front legs.\n\nI do have a feisty personality and I am quite strong-willed. Some training and positive reinforcement will go a long way for me, since afterall, I am still a pup! I am curious, smart and I love to be mentally stimulated. And I do have a mind of my own. I will fetch when I want it. :D Behavioral training has been helping me tons. But I do guarantee, that a life with me will be full of the most amazing moments. Nothing less than a firecracker life, with this firecracker! I will need dedicated time for my care, therapy and clean-ups. If you are ready for an extraordinary life with a true blue rescue, come and say hi! My adoption fee is $150 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here https://theanimalpad.org/adoption-application/",

We are working to get more information to you about this dog within a couple days.\n\nMy name is Kaiser and my best friend is my sister, Ava. We were dumped in El Paso Texas and ended up in fear for my life in NM. When the Big Mutt Network heard about me and my sister they swooped in but now were wondering where do we go next? \n\nI love to play, I love toys, I am curious and cautious but after I warm up all the new things in my life I become funnier and funnier! I LOVE playing with my dog friends and would really love to stay with my sister but as long as I have companion I will be okay. Is it really that much harder to feed two of us? We promise we will eat out of the same bowl!\n\nWe are young, housebroken, sweet and ready!",

He doesn\u2019t like long car rides, I think he gets motion sick, but likes short ones. He walks well, with manners, but you have to show you\u2019re in charge. He is potty trained. He loves looking out the front window. He is good with older kids, because he doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s big. \n\nStorms cause him anxiety, unless he\u2019s by you. \nHe really prefers to be solo with his human, not fond of sharing toys. He is a definite lap dog. He LIVES FOR walkies as we call them. He will go to his leash all the time, but he\u2019s older now so he doesn\u2019t like to go very far as he gets super tired. The less humid the farther we go. Loves his toys and tearing up squeaky tennis balls.\nIf he is over an adventure, he will lay down. And be annoyed if you make him get up to go to the car. I thought he was like sick once, but he was literally just protesting.\nHe does have separation and confinement issues.\nBig Mike, above all else, is a lover. \nHe\u2019s afraid of \u201calpha dogs\u201d and doesn\u2019t play well with cats or small animals. Loves kiddos, and cuddles from them, but not his ears pulled or being poked. Definitely a mix between lap dog and Mr. Independent. In classic big dog fashion, doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s big! He thinks that beds and couches are free game. He\u2019s a dog that needs interaction. He craves it with his humans. He doesn\u2019t like being left alone and can get very, very anxious. He has passed two training programs, but he will totally pretend sometimes that he has no idea what any basic command is until you pause and give him the eyebrow.  If he does something he shouldn\u2019t, call him Michael and he puts himself in time out. He\u2019s a great boy, but if adopted, will require patience while he adapts.",

Once he knows you are not out there to hurt him he warms up pretty quickly. \n\nLevi is ok with other dogs. He is selective. \n\nLevi loves women and can be a real charmer. He also gets along very well with other dogs. He is very suspicious of men in general and will take some time to trust them. Once he is convinced that you are not going to hurt him he will be extremely loyal. \n\nLevi has been in a 4-week training camp and know basic commands and walks on the leash very mannerly. His trainer Reann says about him: \"Levi's new person must be willing to continue the training he started with us. He knows sit, down, stay, heel and come on the leash.\"",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Orchid is an adorable 3.5 year old terrier mix that was born on or around 9/4/217. She came into rescue with her puppies. All of Orchids puppies have found their forever home and this sweet momma is ready for hers.\n\nOrchid spent most of her day's living in a ditch so it wasn't a surprise when we learned she is Heartworm Positive. Orchid has started treatment and is available for adoption. Amazing Grace will continue to pay for her treatments until she produces a negative test (typically 6-12 months after the initial treatment.)\n\nOrchid can be a little shy at first, but her sweet nature overcomes and she warms up. Orchid is great with other dogs, cats, and older children who can understand her boundaries. Amazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you. Our adoption fee for Orchid is $200 and includes her spay, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip. If you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037. You may also send a message to our Amazing Grace Bully Rescue Page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or send an email directly to amazinggracebullyrescue@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer: We are located in the Pensacola, Florida area and will consider local applicants first, especially with puppies since we use a vet in the local area.",

She was picked up as a stray and found herself in the Conroe Animal Shelter in Texas where she became very overwhelmed.  The shelter staff saw how stressed out she was and reached out to one of the volunteers with Lola\u2019s Lucky Day to ask if she could take Claire to her home.  She of course said yes!  Once she was in a foster home, her personality blossomed! \n\nClaire is able to coexist with other  dogs but slow and proper introductions are needed.  She would love an active family and a fenced in yard, although this is not a requirement.  Claire has a goofy personality, is very intelligent, loves to please, is HIGHLY food motivated and enjoys eating (who doesn\u2019t?!).  She has been working on her leash training, but she could use a little fine tuning of her leash manners.  We would recommend her go to a home with older children who understand boundaries and manners when around dogs.  Claire is crate trained and almost potty trained but can sometimes get an anxious piddle if startled.  If you think Claire could be the girl for you, let us know!",

She stated she does not ever want to share her space with that many other dogs again. She would really prefer a home all to herself with someone that will let her sit in their lap and appreciates her beautiful smile ?. Yes our Penelope smiles, it is very adorable but we have not yet been able to get a picture when she does it. She is so gentle and sweet but does absolutely not care for little dogs and does under no circumstances share her food (or any food she considers hers) she is fine with people in and around her bowl. She gets along with big dogs as long as they are not to overwhelming. She would love a fenced yard. She is crate trained, walks well on a leash and is housebroken and not destructive at all, at least not that we ever observed. No small children please. Let\u2019s get word out this perfect girl is looking for a home.",

She\u2019s curious of her surroundings, so she will need to have a secure fence to keep her from exploring. \n\nBeauty loves kids, but they should be older. She doesn\u2019t know her own strength. \n\nShe gets along with most boy dogs, close to her own age, puppies would probably be too much for her. She can be picky with others. She has been through obedience training with her former family and is an independent spirit who loves kids and adults.\nShe went to an 8-week training program, in Lexington, Friends For Folks, and knows all her basic commands. Exp: Sit, stay, lay down, come, heel, etc.",

Bailey is also learning to walk nicely on leash and would enjoy an adopter to continue helping her work on these skills. Bailey would likely prefer to be the only dog in the home, with a tall fenced yard to run around in!

She was adopted out as a pup and returned when other members of the family brought home dogs that she couldn't get along with, thus causing her to lose her home. We believe Moxie needs a home that loves the American bully cross with a Staffordshire or Pitbull. This breed combination is extremely loyal, affectionate and protective, so experience is absolutely needed for an adopter. Experience with either breed or both is a plus!\n\nMoxie learns quickly, walks well on a leash, takes to training like a fish to water, swims in water like a true fish, plays with toys and doesn't mind sharing with her person, and will truly be a partner til the end. She has shown an inclination to attach to her handlers, so multiple person households have to work with her equally. We advise no little children as she is a big girl and needs an adult leader as well as a home that can focus on her needs. We also are looking for an active household that enjoys being outside, walking/hiking and exploring, this young lady needs her mind to be nourished by mother nature's medicinal presence.\n\nMoxie is currently in a training program where she learns basic obedience, leash skills and socializing alongside new people and dogs. We expect an owner to be open to training and commit to learning about Moxie alongside us.\n\nIf interested call us at 847-338-3252 or email at Info@redemptionroadinc.org",

            "description": "Hi!  My name is Grainger.  I'm a young labrador retriever and cattledog mix about 1-1/2 yrs old who was turned into Rescue when my owner did not come find me after i got lost.  I am a nice friendly boy so when no one responded to the \"found dog\" postings, i came to Rescue to make sure i would stay safe.  I am a friendly dog, good with other dogs and people.  I am very agile and like to climb so i do need a very secure environment with a 6' fence and supervision when I am outside. and lots of attention.  I am young and busy so I would be best in a home where i have a k9 buddy and/or someone is home to keep me company.  I would be best in a home with owners experienced with high energy dogs.  Rescue has had me neutered and vaccinated so i'm ready to go home when the right home and family comes along.  I'm enjoying my stay here with Rescue, lots of fun time with other dogs, but i am missing having a family of my own to love ... Couldn't you make room in your home and your heart for a friendly spotted boy like me?\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please email Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California at dalrescue@sbcglobal.net, tell them you are interested in meeting me and you will be send an adoption questionnaire to be completed and emailed back.  You should also be able to access the questionnaire on line from our website homepage, www.dalrescuesocal.com.  Once the completed questionnaire has been received and if it looks like I might be a good fit for you and your family, arrangements can be quickly made for you and your family and other dog if you have one, to come meet me.  I like making new friends so please, contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc. by email as soon as you can, and ask about me, Grainger.  Thanks.\n\nTo learn more about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., a 501c3 non-profit charity, and to see all of our available dogs, please visit our website at www.dalrescuesocal.com.

This may not necessarily be a bad thing, she may want to play but would most likely play too rough so we prefer a home with older children or no children if possible. She loves snuggles and attention from people. \nHer favorite thing to do is take naps on the couch. For the next few months she needs to be kept in a calmer environment to avoid blood clots until she is retested for her heartworm situation. If you have further questions regarding medical needs please reach out to us. In general she just needs a quiet home. We can only do a foster to adopt situation for her as she needs to get retested in a few months. Message us if you\u2019d like to apply. \n",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble.

This darling three-legged boy has the dreamiest brown eyes and will win you over with his sweet disposition and loving gaze.   Joey is approximately 16- 18 months old and has many great years ahead to shower his family with love and provide lots of laughs.\n\nJoey's ready for the best of his life with a family of his own and his perfect match would be someone who loves dogs and and will help him feel safe and at ease in his new home environment.  Joey has done great with sweet, neutral females and done well with proper introductions of male dogs.   Joey has been around children and been very sweet but has always been actively supervised, as all dogs should be.\n\nJoey loves learning and a trainer will facilitate his meet & greet with his lucky family!  \n\nJoey was rescued from Miami Dade Animal Services with an open fracture to his left, front leg and a neurological injury to the right, front leg that resulted in an amputation.     That doesn't get Joey down, and this three legged wonder can dash great distances, especially if he\u2019s chasing down lizards or squirrels - oh yes, this angel has a strong prey drive so no chickens, lizards or other small creatures for this guy's new home!\n\nIf you can\u2019t resist this handsome boy\u2019s eyes and are interested in making him your new furry best friend, please complete the adoption application and tell us a little about yourself.  You may be the perfect match for darling Joey!",

Joey's been making friends with doggies and does well with proper introductions and with respectful pups.    He sometimes tires easily on walks but enjoys time outside and shows a lot of interest in squirrels and lizards so has a high prey drive for chasing quick moving critters.\n\nJoey suffered a severe fracture to his left, front leg and had surgery to repair the fracture and is fully recovered.    This sweet angel also a neurological  injury to his other front leg that required amputation but he doesn't let having three legs get him down.  \n\nHe loves people and enjoys treats, cuddles and hanging with his family.   Ideally, Joey will live in a first floor home so that he can go right outside to potty.    Joey has not been with children and he would do best in a home with oder kids - 12 or so and above, and loves learning.  His new family will get an amazing family pet, fully vaccinated, microchipped and neutered and ready for the rest of his life in  a home of his own.\n\n\n",

My foster family sometimes calls me Wonky Gronky because my right ear doesn\u2019t lay down, I have two different color eyes and I have an underbite - but they say that\u2019s part of what makes me so irresistibly cute!  The other part comes from my sweet, human-adoring personality!\nI am 2.5 years old and came back to the rescue after learning that I would thrive better in an environment without small animals (I like to bark at small dogs) or small children...I\u2019m a bit of a nervous fellow. However, because the wonderful people at Adore-A-Bull saw that I needed some structure and training, they brought me back and are putting me through a board-and-train program! Now I\u2019m gaining the confidence to be the bestest, happiest doggo I can be!\nI weigh about 50 lbs and have a boxer-type build. I get along great with my siblings - both four-legged and two-legged. When I get free time at training my favorite thing is to lay my head on my trainer\u2019s knee - I just love him so much! My foster mom says someone is going to be really lucky when they take me home for forever...could it be you?!\n.\nIf you are interested in GRONK or any of our dogs, you must live with a 40 mile radius of the Downtown Cincinnati, OH area. Please go to www.adoreabull.org/interested to learn how to start an adoption process.\n\nIf you have questions on why we restrict our adoption area, please go back get to http://adoreabull.org/interested/adoption-radius/\n.\n#adoptdontshop #adoreabullresq #gronksmash #dontbullymybreed #dogsofcincy #cincy #pitstagram #rescuedismyfavoritebreed",

To apply for this dog, please go to www.adoggie4you.org. Please no phone calls. Adoption fee for this dog is $200. The dog is approximately 6 years old.\n\nMy name is Booger. I used to have a daddy that was a special friend to A Doggie 4 You, but one day he sat down in his chair and we couldn't wake him up. We kept trying for several days. We were very hungry and scared. It was really hot and we didn't know what to do. Finally we heard people trying to break in. We knew we had to protect daddy, so we wouldn't let them in. We did our best, but these men in uniforms came in and put a tight noose around our necks and dragged us away. We fought hard and were very scared, especially when we were thrown in a closed truck then a scary pen that was very noisy.\n\nFinally a friend of our foster mom came to pick us up. We heard them trying to convince her to let them put us to sleep. But she said no and they loaded us up and took us to the ranch. We were really scared when we got there, even though we knew our foster mom. But we didn't trust anyone. It didn't take long for us to recognize we weren't in danger anymore. We still miss dad, but our foster mom is really nice and she says she misses dad too. The nice people here taught us how to walk on a leash, get in a kennel, and play with toys. We are really excited about finding a new family. I really like to play with small boys. I used to have a neighbor who would come play with me. I do have a little arthritis, so I can't run too long. I am also a little overweight, so they have me on a diet.",

Sadly, her body shows the signs of many litters of puppies and her fear of people leads us to believe she had a rough past. Luckily, those days are behind her now, and while she has some struggles to work through, it\u2019s all up from here for this loveable girl! \n\nVenus loves the resident dogs she currently lives with but is wary of strange dogs and would likely need slow intros to any new dogs. She chases all small animals she sees so she should not be placed in a home with cats or other small animals.  She also should not be homed with children at this time due to her fear of strangers and her tendency to very jumpy and mouthy when overly excited.\n\nOnce you enter her circle of friends, Venus is a super sweet and loving girl. She enjoys cuddling with her people and will nudge for non-stop pets. She loves playing fetch and will bring the ball back each time so you can throw it again! She knows sit, down, paw, touch and is a master at \u201con your bed\u201d which gives her structure and the direction to calm down when she gets too excited. She enjoys going for walks in quiet places and frequently checks in with her handler. \n\nVenus is slow to trust and will require someone who will continue to give her positive associations with people to help her grow and work through her stranger danger. She also requires structure and enrichment in her life so she can be the best version of herself. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in being Venus\u2019s fetch buddy, please fill out a survey today at  https://www.playersforpits.com/adoption-survey!",

In Thor's words:\n\n'I have to laugh when I remember back to the day I was rescued by Robin Hood Animal Rescue.\n\nI had them trying to corner me when they attempted to gain my trust with food. It took four of them, a screen barrier, a fenced in yard and an airline carrier.\n\nI was slow to adjust to my new surroundings. I was not used to being inside a house and having humans to love and care for me.\n\nI will need a family who understands how a Husky can be.\n\nI love hugs. I am worthy of hugs!!!!\n\nI love playing around.\n\nI still need work on being leash trained.\n\nBut I am DEFINITELY WORTH IT. Just ask my foster folks.'\n\nAs with all our foster dog children, Thor has been altered, microchipped and has had his shots.\nPlease text or call Bob at (623) 680-1170 for more information on this furry character.\nJanuary 2021: THE USUAL ADOPTION FEE FOR DOGS/PUPPIES VARIES GIVEN AGE, BREED, ETC..

            "description": "Charlie is a laid back male Pit Bull. He was brought in by his family due to divorce and not being able to keep him.  He has a sweet and laid back personality. He came from a home with children and other pets, but we still recommend he meets everyone before taking him.  He dearly wants a home that will be his forever home. \n\nHe is 5 years old.  He is neutered. His current weight is around 65 pounds. \n\n Charlie's fee is $150.00. The adoption fee includes the initial vaccines, spay/neuter surgery, microchipping and a deworming. \n\nWe are currently only open by appointment. Due to the recent pandemic, we are looking at the safety of our workers/volunteers that are there to take care of the animals. Only serious inquiries will be considered.\n\nPlease visit our website to fill out an application so we can better assist you in your search for your next fur baby.  http://www.achs-pets.com/Application.html \n\nWe are a BEST MATCH facility. We try to match the pet\u2019s personality and needs with the family\u2019s needs and lifestyle to increase the likelihood of a lifetime happy relationship for the whole family. The online application we provide on our website, achs-pets.com, is a preliminary application. After you have completed the application, please give us 3 to 5 business days to process it. We check vaccine records for current & past pets as well as Landlord approval if you do not own your home. We hope you will understand our effort to provide our animals with the best new situation that is possible.",

Precious, who weighs 17lbs, prances when going for long walks and scouting for lizards. She loves to snuggle under a blanket and hops right up in the car for a joy ride. She is a quiet dog with A+ manners. She is fully house broken, never barks and is gentle with every animal and person she meets. *Precious needs a family that is able to give her pills four times a day* and manager her seizure disorder so we think the ideal adopter is someone with a flexible schedule or is home most of the day. Abandoned Pet Rescue will continue to provide her medication, which has been very affective in controlling her seizures. If you would like to meet sweet Precious, please fill out an application at www.abandonedpetrescue.orgTo meet this adoptable pet, please fill out an adoption application at www.abandonedpetrescue.org and a team member will contact you to schedule an appointment.",

            "description": "Because of the current situation with the COVID-19 (Corona) virus, in-person home visits are not possible at this time. Since this is a very important part of finding the best home for our dogs, we are not accepting any applications from first-time pet owners, applicants who have not had a pet in the past 3 years, or applicants who cannot furnish vet records.  We hope you understand and that you will consider applying to adopt once restrictions have been lifted.\n\nDante is approximately 10 years old, weighs 23 lbs and has a natural tail.  He is partially blind but still has vision in his left eye.  He gets eye drops 3 times daily which he does not like very well, but he can be bribed with treats.   He has allergies and itchy skin so he is on Benadryl, special food and supplements.  His coat has improved and is now nice and shiny.  He does well with grooming.\n\nDante loves to be outside and enjoys chasing squirrels, etc.  Swimming has been encouraged, but he is not quite there yet.  He is a barker, which we are trying to discourage with a special collar.  He LOVES to go anywhere is the car.  He will eat just about anything, but he likes to be left alone while eating.\n\nHe is very sweet but can be skittish at times, which suggests that he may have been abused at some time in his past.  He likes to sleep with his humans occasionally.  He does well with adults and most other dogs but not sure about children or cats.  This special boy is looking for his forever home.\n\nIf you would like to meet Dante, please complete our adoption application and put his name at the top.  http://dfwcockerrescue.org/ under Adoptions, Adoption Information.\n\n<BR><BR>\n<b>For more pictures and information about this and all the cockers available at DFW Cocker Spaniel Rescue please visit our website at www.dfwcockerrescue.org</b>\n",

            "description": "Thank you Artful Gardener!\n\n'We have a soft spot for animals and Joyful Rescues here at The Artful Gardener! We're grateful to have held the Cabin Fever Party and Rescue Fundraiser before the shut-down happened and even more grateful that Joyful is able to continue its mission to save the lives of homeless pets. We have two (Lily and Toby) very special Joyful Alum in our household and it's impossible to imagine life without them! We know that these rescued pets will be well cared for until they're placed into the loving arms of their new families; that is why we're such big fans of Joyful Rescues! Thank you for saving these beautiful animals!\nThanks again for all you do!\nJean'\n\nMagnolia was born around August 8, 2018 and weighs about 50 pounds. Magnolia is wonderful with all us humans and she would love another active, rough and tumble, dog in her next life. She is a rather rough player so the dog should be her size or larger and want to PLAY! We have found, as most Pointers, that she has too much interest in cats to live with any. We feel she will be fine with children old enough not to tumble easily. She is highly affectionate and loves to snuggle, but not until the play is done. She comes beautifully when called, but in a safely fenced/contained area as she is a Pointer mix and they usually have wanderlust. Magnolia is good in the car and does pretty well on leash.\nThis is all we know so far and we will be learning as we go and so will you!\n\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $350.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY. Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES We keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption. Can't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME Look for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\n\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

Her ideal home will be a stable, structured environment with a safe yard for energetic play. Maxine is an exceptionally athletic and eager playmate who will require a good throwing arm for her favorite pastime! She is a devoted dog who thrives under a caring, committed and confident master. Otherwise, she tends to be insecure, which manifests as reactivity toward strangers, unfamiliar dogs and surprise situations. Slow intros are a must with new dogs, and she needs time to warm up to unknown people. Maxine has had muzzle training to help ensure safety during initial encounters. Once she learns to trust and feels secure, she blossoms into a faithful and endearing pup! Maxine has made impressive progress over the past several months but will need continued guidance to reach her full potential and live her best life. With the right leadership, she will make a phenomenal addition to the right home and lucky adopter(s)!\n\nPlease Note: All dogs are posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at www.lasthopek9.org.\n\nQuestions? Please email adoptions@lasthopek9.org. For more photos, or information on upcoming adoption events where you can meet her, please go to www.lasthopek9.org or go to our Facebook page.

She has done well with both dogs and cats. \n\nShe would do best in an active home with a canine friend to wrestle, run and play with. \n\nShe is crate trained, walks well on leash and knows sit, down and stay. Bissou would do best with an owner that is interested in continuing training.\n\nBissou is up to date on shots and preventatives and is microchipped.  Bissou\u2019s adoption fee is $250 plus any additional donation you feel appropriate.  Our adoption fee is set to a level to make adoptions happen.  They do not cover our costs. Thank you for your generosity and interest in our dogs!   \n\nAll dogs adopted locally through SGDR receive a free six-week session of obedience classes and a lifetime of behavior support through our Project REWARD program with trainer Charlotte Blake.\n\nYou must have an approved application before being able to visit a dog. Visit our website below for an adoption application https://www.snootygiggles.com/dog-application/\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.",

They reached out on social media and a rescuer with a big heart who knew Sumo from the shelter said that he would help them out and brought Sumos story to a Rescuer with Mutts In Need\n\nWe are still getting to know Sumo but so far we know he is a low-key boy and prefers dogs that are not going to slobber all over him or try to be dominant. People are always asking us for dogs that can be by themselves and we hardly ever have them. Sumo is one that for sure can either be by himself or hang with a couple other dogs. He is such a good  boy.  We also know he enjoys affection,  getting baths and walks nice on a leash. \n\nSumo loves to go for walks and hikes. He enjoys good food, soft ear rubs and a soft bed. He is house trained and ready for his forever home. \n\n We would like to place him in a home that is low key and preferably no young kids.  This mellow boy has been through a lot and deserves a home where he can relax and just enjoy life.\n\nIf you have shepherd experience, or the very minimum large breed experience,  please fill out an application. \n",

She was rescued from the streets of Texas, and she has now completed obedience training and has been happily acclimating to her foster home. Bella is energetic and loves to play. She gets attached to her owner once a bond has been formed and can be protective. She needs a calm and patient introduction with strangers. Bella would do best with a dedicated, experienced and confident owner who will consistently and firmly continue her training and form a trusting and safe relationship. We do not recommend a home with young kids or cats at this time, as she has not been tested with them and due to her overprotective nature. She comes with free lifelong training classes which are held in Long Island. Familarity and experience with shepherds is required.",

Unfortunately I see horrible things all day, while they all affect me, I have learned how to compartmentalize in most situations. However every now and then a dog comes along that literally shakes me to my core. A dog that you read their story and look at their photos and/or video and have to remind yourself to breathe again. This dog did this to me, my eyes filled with tears and I couldn't comparmentalize it, I couldn't refocus and continue my day as planned. This is his brief story:\n\n\"Dawson came in today after being found hiding in the dog house of his yard. His \"brother\" had starved to death after their owner passed away in the house. We arent sure how long he had been gone, he had no friends or family around here. Dawson is SO SAD, he just lies in his kennel and wont get up. \"\n\nI cannot imagine the mental anguish he suffered watching his brother starve to death as food, at that time, was plentiful for him but his brother couldn't get to it. I cannot imagine the confusion and fear when his owner never came back and eventually he smelled the stench of decomposition. He retreated into his dog house when his food was gone, he was preparing for the same slow, agonizing death he watched his brother suffer. I cannot imagine the pain and toll this has taken on him, but my heart is shattered. \n\nPlease welcome Wilbur (he doesnt know Dawson, and Wilbur just fits him) to High Plains PAW. I promise you will never be scared and suffering ever again. I promise we will get some of this weight off you so the rest of your time on this earth will be less physically painful. I promise that you are so extremely loved and I will spend every ounce of my being make sure you know that for the rest of your life. We cannot undo your suffering or erase your past, but we will focus on your future and make it more spectacular than you could even dare to imagine.\n\nAlso, PLEASE have a plan for your animals in case of your demise. This is sad on multiple levels, for the man who died and literally no one even knew he was gone, for the dogs, for everyone this has impacted. Please have a plan, part of responsible ownership and unconditional love is recognizing the need for future care for the animals.\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES.

AND I found out the other dogs are pretty nice, too!! Now I know I don't have to be scared anymore! I'm an active guy who enjoys a good pettin' and lots of playing!! I'm about 4 1/2 yrs old and I only weigh ~50 pounds!!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Juliet arrived in her Maryland foster home on September 19. Such a pretty name for such a pretty dog. Sadly her former life has left her emotionally scarred. She is distrustful of people, and painfully shy. At the shelter she snapped at people coming into her bubble. In her foster home she just cowers and doesn't take any joy in human interaction or being petted. At this time she stays on a 25 foot leash when she goes outside in the fenced yard, just so we can catch her and reel her back in. Thankfully she's fine with the other dogs and cats, and seems to thrive on a routine. We hope with some time she will come around and learn that people can be good and that petting and love are to be enjoyed, but she's not there yet. If she is to be adopted in the near future, she will need an adult only household and a very secure fenced area. She is a high flight risk.\n\nUpdate 11/9/20, sadly Juliet shows only minimal improvement. During the day, we can let her outside with a reasonably good chance of coming in on her own. At night when we let her out, she must have the leash on. She does like a routine, and although I'm not sure you can call it \"liking\", but she seems to tolerate my elderly mother better than me, but she still does not show affection towards anyone and startles very easily. I wish I had a better update. Only time will tell if she'll improve.If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested.

A fine friend, this dog would be an outstanding addition to any family!\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

A fine friend, this dog would be an outstanding addition to any family!\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

He will have to be on limited activity for a month afterwards.<P>\n\nTAE is a friendly, 2-year-old (as of 8/30/20), 50-pound Boxer and Labrador Retriever mix.\n\nHe's sweet, social, and good-natured.  A fine friend, this dog would be an outstanding addition to any family!\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

Her gray eyes are perfectly color-coordinated with her coat!\n Bleu Diamond is a happy little girl who is learning all about the joys of being a valued family member and navigating a new world! A bit shy at first when meeting new people, she will quickly show off her wiggly butt and happy face after a sniff or two. Bleu Diamond is more reserved around men, so she needs a few more minutes to warm up. She needs to be an only dog with an active family. This is a Velcro girl, who is most relaxed when she is around her people. \nBleu Diamond is very curious and playful, and loves running after her toys and chewing on her bones and thick-braided ropes. She is looking for a home with a fenced-in backyard so she can zoom around and roll in the soft grass. Although she's energetic, when it's naptime, she is happy to curl up in her crate or on her blankets. Very eager to please and highly food-motivated, Bleu Diamond is making tremendous progress in her training. She is house-trained and crate-trained, knows Sit and Down, and is working on her leash training. There is so much to sniff and investigate and . . . um, including things on the kitchen counter!\nBleu Diamond will need her forever family to commit to building her confidence and transitioning into their world. She tells me she is looking forward to sharing some serious laptime as a pampered princess!\n Bleu Diamond's owners had to move and could not take her with them.\n Read more about Bleu Diamond on the Independent Animal Rescue website at https://animalrescue.net/dogs/d-20-141/.",

Sadly his owner never appeared and now Benjamin is with us looking for his new home. This little guy is all love and will be your shadow as he follows you around...if you are looking for a devoted and loving companion \"Benji\" is your boy! Benjamin could stand to go on a weight loss program so if you need a walking partner that would suit him well :-). He gets along great with everyone, including cats, and he specially loves to go for car rides - he will look out the window without falling asleep until the car stops-- he is a very good co-pilot LOL. Benjamin does have a low grade 2 heart murmur for which he takes low cost medication for but this in no way gets in the way of flying out the backdoor to play with his foster fur siblings. If interested in adopting Benjamin please fill out an application at www.floridacockerrescue.org ADOPTION FEE: $225.00\n",

If you're looking for a young, active dog, that is ready for adventure, and is super cute to boot then you couldn't ask for a better dog than Buford.\n\nHe loves to playing chase and wrestling with other dogs, tossing his toys into the air and trying to play fetch until he gets so distracted that he ends up just doing zoomies around the yard. He is bursting with energy and has lived most of his short life in shelters so he would benefit from someone who can continue to work with him on his basic training and manners. He has guarding issues around food and handling due to a rough start in his former shelter, but he is eager to learn and please so it is easy to work with him.\n\nBuford can't wait to get out of here and start his life with a loving, patient family. If you are looking for adventure and want to be endlessly entertained then Buford is the dog for you!",

            "description": "Age: 3 years\nWeight: 68lbs\nGender: Male\nEnergy Level: High\nOverall Drive: Moderate \nLocation: Bothell, WA\n\nGantu is playful, funny, affectionate, and very eager to please. Desperately loyal, he is very obedient and bonds very closely with his handler. If he were a human, he\u2019d be a high-ranking police officer, strict and a rule-follower with good leadership qualities who is serious about protecting those around him.\n\nBecause he is still learning to trust those other than his handler, he takes a while to warm up to other humans. He will need a handler that can be patient with him and work with him through slow introductions to people both in and out of his home. Gantu has done well with other dogs, but because of his protective nature would be best matched with a neutral male dog or a female dog close to his size. He rides well in the car in his crate, is comfortable around loud noises, and he requires fair but firm correction. Gantu will require a handler who has Belgian Malinois experience who is committed to continuing his training and will be able to work with him through some of his more complex issues such as separation anxiety and destructive behavior. He is working on basic obedience and is fully crate trained. Gantu does not like water, so would do best in a home that isn\u2019t interested in any water-based activities.\n\nGantu\u2019s ideal home would be one with a breed-savvy handler who is committed to continuing his training, ensure controlled introductions to both people and other dogs, and who can be patient with him as he grows. He would do well in a calm home that offers opportunity for him to get controlled exercise.\n\nWEST COAST ADOPTIONS ONLY\n\nMust have previous or current, purebred Malinois experience OR other high drive working breed experience\n\nOur adoption process includes- completion of an application, followed by a telephone interview. If that goes well, we will arrange for a home visit.\nAdoption Fee: $500.00. Transport along Interstate 5 (Bakersfield, CA to Bellingham, WA) is available but cost not included in adoption fee. \n\nPlease visit www.woofproject.org and fill out an adoption application located here https://www.woofproject.org/application",

It was pretty rough, but I knew as soon as Chain of Hope came, my life was going to change! At Chain of Hope, I was able to run around and play and I haven't stopped smiling since. I am currently in a foster home and loved going on walks. I am a pro at walking on a leash. I am a little dog selective, but cats don't bother me at all. If you are looking for a big guy to take walks with, I am just the one! I would love a home with some land to romp around on. I love going on hikes and I LOVE car rides. \n\n*Currently in training with The Pet Connection\n*Fritz is in a foster home with two cats and doing great\n*Good with cats and other dogs\n*Not good with children\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please visit www.chainofhopekc.org and fill out an adoption application. Once received someone from our team will be right with you.\n\n**Local Adoption Only - Kansas City Area**\n\nAdoption fee includes deworming, all vaccinations, rabies tag, micro-chip, spay/neuter, heart worm test, flea & tick prevention, and heart worm prevention.",

She is maybe a Greyhound/Lab /Terrier mix- so she has some energy. She loves to run and walk and chase bunnies on her walks and play with other dogs. She needs a proper introduction when first meeting other dogs and cats then she is fine; hence an experienced handler is preferred. She is a large girl, about 60 lbs. She rides well in the car, is housetrained and would do better with a family who has another playful dog .\n\nDue to her size and energy level, she would be better in a house with a yard vs. a condo and older children. As well, she prefers a family who is home more than gone as she still has some puppy tendencies and is Houdini with a crate.\n\nShe would be a great jogging and hiking buddy!!! She has been spayed so no more babies for this momma! Adoption fee: $250. Fee includes her spay, current vaccinations, and microchip. For a profile with an adoption application, visit https://spotsavespets.org/dogs-n-puppies/ .. To follow Paloma on her way to a loving family on SPOT's Facebook page, visit https://facebook.com/spotsavespets/\n\n2/2/21 2:49 PM",

My brother has been adopted and now it's my turn! When I arrived at ARFhouse, I was heartworm positive; so it took me a little longer to get ready for my new home, but I'm ready now! \n\nI am quite possibly the sweetest dog you will ever meet! I love people, other dogs, kids and I LOVE to play!! I am silly and constantly making people laugh with my larger than life personality. I am a mixed breed, approximately 2 years old and I weigh 42 lbs. I would love a home with another dog for me to play with! I know I look like I'm just a puppy, but I promise I'm not; I have a forever-puppy face. \n\nThe fee to adopt Oreo is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Oreo, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Oreo is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Oreo, please fill out an application on our website. If approved, we will contact you within 48 hours to set up a time to meet Oreo.",

She was raised with sheep.\n\nPotential adopters need to read up on the Akbash breed before considering adopting Tess.\n\nSDR is partnering to help find her forever home... we just love the Akbash, although they are not a good breed for most people. Independent, bred to bark and large. \n\nFor more info:  Kris Sharp              sharp_kris@yahoo.com",

I really am just a happy pup looking for a home to grow old with a heart full of love and kisses. If you want to make my dreams a reality, please consider adopting me! Keep in mind, I will require some training.\n\nTo adopt, fill out an application at\n\nwww.paws4you.org/application\n\nTo get our newsletter, text\nPAWS4YOU\nto\n22828\n\nConnect with us:\n\nwww.instagram.com/paws4you\n\nwww.twitter.com/paws4you\n\nwww.facebook.com/paws4you",

It is so bad for their joints for 3 legged dogs to be overweight!!\n\nShe was not been cared for with even basic vetting but we brought her up to date and she's on her way to her goal weight. She came in with Buddy but they are not bonded and can be adopted separately as long as there's another dog friend in her forever home. She deserves a happily ever after.\n\nDo you need walking buddy to help you lose your added quarantine weight? Dolly could be your personal trainer! She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Adoption donation is $150.\n\nIf you would like to meet any of our dogs please fill out an adoption application on www.maxxandme.org\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

She looked to have been dragged by a car, all of her paws were very wounded and tore up. She was so scared, and intimidated by us but she let us help her. We cleaned her wounds as best we could and the next morning took her to the vet to get her checked out. Most of her toes were broken in her one paw, you could count every bone in her body. \n\nLana is still at vet, she is being treated for her wounds, infections, and getting all the food and attention she wants. We are hoping to have her in our care soon, once she is healthy enough to leave the vet!!\n\nPlease help give this sweet girl a forever home of her own, that will love her unconditionally and treat her like a family member!",

ADR is not responsible for the health, temperament, behavior or placement of this dog. Listings are done at the request of the dog's owner and as an outreach and community service in hopes of finding these dogs a loving, stable forever home. Placement decisions are made solely at the discretion of the owner and not Austin Dog Rescue. Owners are required to ask for an adoption fee from adopters.\n\nThis is the information that we received from Gulliver's current family:\n\nBoris, our son and daughter-in-law\u2019s dog, bit their toddler about 10 months ago. Prior to that incident, Boris had never shown any aggressive tendencies \u2013 ever. Ian had food in his hand, and was passing Boris in a tight space. No one had an actual visual of the incident- they just heard Boris give a quick growl and snap. Boris bit Ian\u2019s jaw, which was snout level for Boris. The bite broke the skin, and was traumatic for everyone. The vet was contacted immediately after the incident, and said the best thing was to keep Boris and Ian in separate rooms. They had never existed in an environment of having Boris secluded; this was not a realistic or fair to Boris. Boris has been temporarily rehomed with our brother-in-law, Danny, while we continued searching for a new home. Danny fosters cats, and has officially adopted two geriatric cats, one of which is unable to jump up on a platform to eat cat food. Boris loves cat food, and Danny cannot keep Boris away from the cat food. Bottom line: Danny is committed to cats over dogs. \nSince COVID, I help care for our grandson, Ian, 3 afternoons a week. Our first priority is ensuring a safe environment for our grandchild; thus, we are unable to keep Boris. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting this handsome fella', please contact Joseph at: joenorton15@gmail.com",

As the family was expanding and creating a busier household, Roscoe just didn\u2019t like all the strangers. He is a very very sweet boy. He adores women and most men. He is very picky when it comes to men. Roscoe is house trained, crate trained, and very mannerly in the home. He needs to go to a home that is a little quieter with no children. He\u2019s fine with most kids but kids have friends and can create a busy home. Roscoe likes to be outside but prefers to be inside on his dog bed hanging out! He\u2019s a super cool boy! \nHis adoption donation is $250. The adoption donation covers his dewormings, yearly shots, heartworm test, neuter, and a microchip!

            "description": "Puppy shenanigans - everywhere, just puppy shenanigans. That is me, Bentley. I am an 8 month old puppy on the hunt for my people. I don't really have a solid story about where I came from, all I know is that one day, the luckiest day of my life, I became a Bella baby. I have grown up without much structure so I am really needing a human to set some boundaries and teach me my manners. I am not a bad little fella, just a pup that needs a little guidance. Let's just say I am wiggly, and goofy and am desperate to learn where my place is with a new family. Since no one has ever told me \"no\" or even took the time to teach me right from wrong, I got off on the wrong paw in my life start. Being in foster care has been wonderful. A life changer, my second chance. \n\nMy new family should probably not have any little people or older people because I currently think it is okay to jump. Breaking that habit is a work in progress but for now, I might just knock over a little or an older friend. I have all this energy, puppy energy and I love to play and run. Older kids who would play and exercise me would actually be perfect or an active home with people who just want to include me in their life. Being around people is fabulous, so much better than being alone, I just need someone to believe in me and bring me home knowing that with their love, support and consistency I can be trained to be a very well mannered, bonded family member.\n\nI LOVE going on walks and car rides are totally my jam. I love going places with my foster mom. She even taught me to \"sit\"! \n\nI really am a good boy, I have so much love to offer, I just need to control the goofy puppy that is still living inside me. I mean - look at me! Long legs, like legs for days (so we can walk together). I bet I would be a great running buddy if someone showed me what to do And my eyes. Great, big, beautiful brown eyes - you know you want these staring at you while you eat dinner (I heard that sharing is caring). And I am funny. A great big bundle of awkward fun. I am so ready to be yours. The sooner the better!\nI'm very playful with the other dogs and I know sit and shake. \n\nYou can change your life and mine and there is no better time to do that then now! I'm waiting, let's get forever started! \nIf you would like to meet me, fill out an application and the Bella staff will arrange it. You can also meet me at the Bella adoption center where I am staying.",

It would really be best if she could go straight to a home.  Finding the right home for her is imperative.  \n\nWhat does the right home look like?  ADULTS ONLY, NO KIDS, experienced dog owner, fenced yard and another dog to play and get out her energy with.  Lucy's new family must be able to continue her training with the assistance of the behaviorist.  Lucy plays well with cats and dogs.\n\nLucy went to a behaviorist because she had aggression issues. These are not occurring anymore, since working with the trainer and Lucy is ready to go to her forever home. Lucy does need an experienced owner who will continue with her training, and teach her the right way to act. She needs a strong owner who will show her how to be a good dog so she doesn't go back to her old ways.\n\n\nFor an application email start2nj@yahoo.com.\n\nPlease be certain to fit the above criteria when applying for Lucy.\n\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Mom was a Border Collie, Dad was a German ShepherdCaught you looking! My name is Brando. I am a sweet, loving, cuddle bug. I love to lay in my foster mom's lap and let her rub my tummy while I go to sleep. Sometimes, I will lay this way for hours. I know in a few months, I will be too big for laps, but for now, I love it. And my belly does need a good rub every day.\nI am a puppy, I have very sharp puppy teeth. I am very eager to learn, but until I do, I am not a good match for small children who may get in the way of my mouth. My mom is a small Shepherd/Border collie, and my Dad was the neighbors German Shepherd who couldn't stay in his own yard. I am the last puppy from a litter of 6. I want to find my forever home too! I am loving and smart and will be your loyal companion for life. I am 90% house trained but I will have accidents in the house if I am busy and cant make it out side. I am too little to be 100% trained yet. So I am going to need some training. I will never be an outside dog. That just is not in my future. But, if you invest in my training, I will be the best dog ever! If you want the most gorgeous puppy you have ever seen, please fill out an application. I will be adopted quickly.\nNOT APARTMENT APPROPRIATE, NO SMALL CHILDREN =========================================================\nPlease contact app@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

He's a sweet pup but prefers a home without any young, unpredictable children. Oliver keeps a clean kennel and walks well on a leash. \n\nFor more info please email dogs@illinoisvalleyanimalrescue.net  or fill out the adoption application found at www.illinoisvalleyanimalrescue.net.  The application does not commit you to adopting, just helps us find the dog that is the right fit for your family. We do not have open adoption hours due to COVID-19 so an application must be submitted and approved before we set up an appointment for you to meet any of our dogs! It can take up to a week for the Adoption Board to review applications and upon approval will contact you.\n\nAdoption fees are $250 which includes spay or neuter, vaccines- rabies, distemper and bordotella, AVID microchip and county rabies tag.  Seniors- over 8 fee is $125.",

            "description": "Martha is a gentle giant who enjoys spending time with her humans. She is very eager to please and adapts to new routines quickly. Martha is very food motivated and can be persuaded to do just about anything with the promise of a snack! She is well-versed in basic commands and is easily directed into her crate. Her loyal and protective ways would make her an ideal family dog. She is generally a low maintenance pup who requires minimal exercise. Short daily walks should be sufficient for her. She has not shown any signs of toy or food aggression and can handle being left alone at the house. She even understands the difference between dog toys and your shoes and furniture. Martha could use a little work in the leash training department; she tends to pull and attempt to chase small animals while on walks. But with some training and love, she will be on her way to being the perfect companion! Come meet her!",

            "description": "Xena is a 4 year old, 92 pound rottweiler, probably a mix, but we'll go with rottie. She came to us as an owner surrender who could not manage the dog with her lifestyle.  We aren't sure what that means because Xena is a good girl.\n\nXena is probably best as an only dog because she is pretty dominant. If you want to know who in the dog kingdom wears the crown, it would be Xena. She is a very bossy girl and she just wants it the way she wants it. She can and does get along with other dogs, but the dogs needs to be low key and submissive. We'd prefer to just let her go to a home where she can be the Empress of all that She Surveys and who gets ALL the rotisserie chicken and not merely part of it. \n\nXena is exceptionally social with people and she is very well-mannered. She is active and she is athletic which is typical for the breed. She needs a fenced yard with enough room to run because she occasionally feels the need for speed. This dog is housebroken and would not dream of peeing in the house because that is for the uncouth in her mind. She would be best in a home with kids past the age of 8 given her size and power. This is definitely a no cat dog. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/ and email corey@bigfluffydogs.com. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

I was part of a seizure in a neighboring town. 25 of us were brought to the ranch to recover and find a new home. We all came in with skin issues, but we are recovering now that we aren't covered in fleas. We would love to live in a house instead of a mud pit. Would you teach me how to be a lady?

His tail goes non-stop and he can't ever give you enough kisses. Rocky loves kids, treats, car rides, and other laid back dogs. He likes to play in the yard, but what he wants more than anything is to be inside with his family. He is a power chewer and loves a big nylabone that he can chew on. He has done well when left in the house alone, but he will sometimes chew on stuff he isn't supposed to chew on. As long as you pick everything up and shut the bedroom doors he is usually pretty good. NO KITTIES! Fenced yard required. All dogs must be fixed. We adopt to within 12 hours of Boise, ID.

He has a white coat with chocolate markings, plus cute little freckles behind his ears. He needs a home with no cats; please bring your dog over for a meet-and-greet. He's very sweet and wants to be your bestie! He's an affectionate \"leaner\" who will gently lean in on you to soak up all the loving he can get. He's housetrained, and he walks well on his leash. Our kennel manager says, \"When I take him out on walks he loves to sit and snuggle to watch the birds.\" He's neutered, microchipped and up to date on his shots. Buddy would love to take up bird-watching -- or just plain snuggling -- with you! Please watch his video, then come make Buddy your best buddy soon!",

            "description": "Biskit| 3 years old | 27 lbs| Fostered in Trent Hills, ON\n\nHello my human friends, my name is Biskit, like a cookie, I am not a soft cookie, I tend to be a bit more hard, only because of my life history. I come to Canada from Saudi Arabia, In Saudia Arabia I was hit by a car during my life on the streets, please don't let the gait in my walk deter you from loving me. When I was hit by a car I had no one to help me so I had to heal on my own. I can't tell you how hard it is to heal your body when you have no food and water to nourish yourself with.\n\nI was discovered by a caretaker who cleaned that restaurant nearby. Every day he would come find me and leave food by me, I couldn't move, I was petrified. Some humans would call it PTSD after being hit by a car, I am not sure about all of that, I just know that I was so petrified after, I trusted no one and was scared stiff, literally guys, I was too afraid to move. That Caretaker was my angel, for his generosity in feeding me, or I would have died for sure.\n \nI was only a puppy when transferred here to Canada. Did I mention you Canadians are some of the friendliest people I've met? However I still arrived full of fear and lacked confidence & I didn't trust you guys yet, so of course there may be a bit of my nipping history, I am not proud of that. I worried every time someone came near me because I thought they wanted to hurt me.\n\nHere's my happier chapter, I hope you enjoy hearing about it as much as I enjoy telling you about it.....I have spent the last few months within a doggie school with a live in trainer. Wow, she really has my heart, I can't tell you just how patient, loving and kind she was with me. No matter how many times I peed in the crate out of fear, or snarled at her, or hid in my crate, she would always wait patiently day after day until I finally came out of my crate and began to live the life I saw other dogs living. She will forever have a piece of my heart.\n\nThanks to her, I am a super trained boy.  I am happy to report that I have officially graduated doggie school with top A+ Grades. My instructor has taught me how to stay, sit, recall, to name a few. More importantly, my instructor is most proud  of how much I have come a long way from the frightened and insecure dog I once was.   \n\nI am a work in progress still, as you humans call me \"A diamond in a rough\" I don't know what that means but it sounds cute, so I'll take it!! \nI am ready for a forever home with someone who can help me continue to thrive, here's what you should know:\n\nI want to live in a rural community, I mean seriously folks, how do you want to live in all of that loud traffic and chaos of the city? NO THANKS!! I would require a backyard since I am very playful and enjoy a good run around! If you have children, I require them to be 13+ years old please. I am totally okay to live with another dog, if that dog is stable, calm and not unpredictable. Now, I don't mean to judge you, and I promise I am not, but you really need to have dog experience for me. I have worked so hard on my doggie training and resource guarding issues, if I go into a home, my human needs to be experienced enough to continue with the training my teacher taught me. Don't worry, my doggie school teacher will prepare you fully on what that entails. Easy Shmeezy!  \n\nI know that I have had an extraordinary life, and I am lucky to be alive. I have waited SO long for a human who is going to take me into their lap and love me. Do you think that's you? I am eager to know more about you so please fill out the adoption application so we can make friends!! Make sure your home has balls, lots of balls and toys to chew on!! I don't want to sound spoiled but I really enjoy playtime!",

He loves his crate as his safe space, he is an escape artist if he wants out he will get out. He would do best with older kids. He is very gentle with our toddler but she is very gentle with him. He is a huge snuggle buddy with those he is close to. Would be best to be an only dog with no other animals.",

            "description": "WALLY ~1 year old. Good with older considerate children and dogs. Cautious with cats, does want to chase and play. Needs a companion animal.\n\nGSRA adopts to residents of VA, NC, and SC only.\n\nI am foxy boy with a lot of energy who wants to be part of your pack. I bark like a Shepherd and I am smart like a Shepherd and I have lots of cuteness going on!\n\nOh Yes I am totally a puppy. I love to play and be free to \"zoom\" around the yard. I play fetch and even bring the toy back to my foster mom or dad! I like all kinds of toys, squeaky toys, tug-of-war toys, tennis balls. But beware I love to chew on toys or bones or rawhides, so keep a supply of chew toys at the ready. If a chew toy is not around, beware that I can get a little mouthy with a soft touch, but I won't try to bite you. My foster parents are working with me to stop being mouthy, but don't forget I still have a lot of puppy in me.\n\nI am pretty quick to learn. My foster mom & dad are working on my basic commands and I'm getting the hang of it when rewarded with a yummy treat. I'm also learning to walk better on leash. I am pulling less and learning to \"heel\", but not so much when I see a squirrel or deer.\n\nIf I meet you in the street, or in my foster home, I'll probably bark at you until I sniff you at my own term. After my sniffing is done, I'll then be happy when you pet me, but my foster parents are working on introducing me to people without a bark, or two. I am crate trained and will sleep in it at night but I also will sleep on a dog bed on the floor, or your bed if you let me.\n\nSo stock up on some toys and let me come into your home!\n\nFrom Wally's Foster Parents:\n\nWally is very much a puppy because he wants to play most of the day, but he does take a couple of naps to build up his energy again. As with all dogs, his current high energy will dwindle as he gets older. Wally will give you many licks if you let him, but when he plays, he very lightly \"mouths\" and at times he runs full speed and could bump into you, for that reason we think that Wally would be a better fit without small children. We are working to lessen and stop the mouthing, but not there yet. Wally has played with a couple of other dogs in a friendly manner, but at times walking through the neighborhood he barks at other dogs with his hackles up. We are also working with him to keep walking, or to sit until another dog passes. We think Wally would be great with the right companion dog that would also help to drain some of his high energy.\n\nWally is housebroken and will sleep through the night. After looking at internet comparison photos, we believe that Wally is more of an Australian Cattle Dog, but still has some German Shepherd looks and of course smartness. He is a medium size dog and currently about 48 LBS which should be his top weight.\n\nWally currently goes on many walks during the day and is left off-leash in a fenced backyard that allows him to \"zoom\" and relieve some energy a few times a day. We would want to place Wally with a family who can let him run, or again play with a friendly or companion dog. Due to Wally's speed, we think he would be great at an \"Agility\" course if trained.\n\nFor more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n\nPlease join us at our next Event(s):\n\nCurrent Scheduled Events:",

            "description": "Georgia Is a two-year-old 48lb lab mix. Georgia is very shy with people but loves other dogs. She must go to a home with another friendly dog. She has a tendency to follow the other dogs leads on how to act with people. Georgia is a low shedder and is housetrained. She loves to go hiking and on trips to the beach with her favorite people who adopted her twin brother Heinz 57.  (You can see him in the picture) She also loves to swim. You can see her enjoyment with dogs and her jumps into the baby pool in the video below. \n\nGeorgia and her brother came from the same hoarder situation as Blossom, Rambo & Kit. All of the dogs are awesome with other dogs but fearful of people they do not know. With the people they DO know they are awesome & extremely loving. They would all do best in a home with another dog, no kids & preferably someone who is familiar with shy and fearful dogs. \n\nTo adopt Georgia you must have:\n- another friendly dog\n- 6ft fence and \n- preferably no kids. \nPlease note that she does not dislike kids but this writer believes kids are loud, scary and leave gates & doors open. We really want Georgia to be adopted into the perfect environment as her brother was. \n\nIf you meet the criteria above and would like to meet Georgia please fill out an application. https://www.muttsinneed.org/adoption-application.html",

He is a little bit shy to start out, but his enjoyment of treats helps to put him at ease. He's a bit independent and an ardent sniffer, and walks quite nicely on the leash. He's a basic, no-drama guy! He's not at all reactive when other dogs approach- in fact, he'd like to meet them! He doesn't seem to have much training but is sweet, gentle, and affectionate. He is coming out of his shell nicely and is a fairly low-key guy- he'd make a great companion! He currently weighs in at 45lbs.",

I'm a nervous boy that was never exposed to much as a puppy and abused by neglect. As a result I'm very \"guarded\" and insecure and become \"territorial and protective\" When I first meet you, I'm shy and coy, but once I know and trust you...I'm right by your side. I need an EXPERIENCED dog handler who will go slow with me at first but be firm and give me daily structured exercise and discipline  to curb my insecurities. I'm a medium energy dog and would make a great jogging/biking/rollerblading partner. I'm cratetrained and housetrained  but could use a bit more work on leash training as I do pull a bit. I'm a bit of a resource guarder with my toys and my bed but not my food. My previous owners never worked with me on this but I can absolutely be trained out of this as I'm a SMART boy that is quick to learn and eager to please. I just need more interactivity and a \"job\" so that I don't get too \"territorial\" and protective. I'm ok with dogs in passing but because I'm not good with sharing things, it's best that I be a SOLO dog  with a SINGLE PERSON and unfortunately NO KIDS. I am FINE WITH CATS. I'm a little scared of them. Even though I'm from the city and used to all the traffic;  I would love a quiet home in the 'burbs with someone that can give me the structure, discipline, exercise & interactivity I need to be a fully balanced dog. IF you're up for the challenge.. I'm WELL WORTH THE EFFORT & promise to be your BFF!!\n\nFor more info/application - pls email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

She had a litter of puppies when she came into rescue who have all been adopted or are in foster homes. Brandy prefers the company of smaller dogs and barks at strangers to alert you to their presence. Brandy likes to be inside and outside and needs a securely fenced yard. She is smart and athletic and would love to learn some basic obedience. Her best friend at the ranch is Marley, a little male terrier. She is available for foster or adopt. Brandy has tested hearworm negative and is spayed, chipped and vaccinated. Her adoption fee is $200 Houston area, or $550 for out of state (includes adoption fee, health certificate, and transportation) and you can apply at www.soca-fbc.org/adoptables.",

He is a senior, but he has a lot of life and spunk in him.  He loves going on walks (preferably in the grass because of his arthritis), getting head, back, and tummy rubs, going on car rides, getting treats, and taking naps on soft doggie beds.  He loves every dog he meets and his adorable curly tail starts wagging as he hangs out with his peeps.  Shoko would do best in a home that has a backyard that he can go out and enjoy and also provides opportunities to do his business.  He needs to go outside multiple times through the day, so he needs someone to be home with him most of the day, or at least only gone for a few hours at a time. \n\n \n\nHe is quiet and only howls when he is excited to see you come home or sad you are leaving, otherwise he doesn\u2019t make any noise.  He does have some arthritis and some pain, so that is managed with his medicine, soft beds, picking him up gently, and grassy walks.  He likes everyone he meets and is not afraid of anything, so he can handle a home that is calm or one that is more lively.  He does just fine with cats and birds and is a just a pretty chill dude.  He transitions to a new home quite easily and is a joy to have around.  \n\nAre you looking for a handsome, sweet guy who will not only melt your heart, but will also get along with everyone?  Then, Shoko is your puggle.  He is a great ambassador for puggles, because he has the wonderful traits of both the beagle and the pug.  And that face\u2026he is just too cute.

This low rider was found happily living in a ditch, and it took volunteers a bit of time to convince him that they\u2019d find him an even better place to live, with AC!  He\u2019s a 4-5 year old corgi/Aussie mix that loves people and other dogs.  Bo can climb chain link, so potential homes with fenced yards must have alternate styles.  NO CATS!!\n\nBo is so cute and happy!  He weighs 35lbs, and due to his herding breed genetics, we will not consider homes with children under age six.  Bo is very snuggly, and adores attention.\n\nTo apply to adopt Bo, please use our Fillable app here:  https://forms.gle/eqEChRtYMPshWYuX8\nWe cannot answer emails at this time due to the number received :(",

She spent some time gaining her trust and capturing her and the pup.  The looked for hours for any other pups.  She never found any and went back later with no luck.  We fear the worst if there were others.  We were contacted to help them.  Momma Sugar has turned into a very sweet and loving dog.  Now at around 43 lbs and fully vetted, she is ready to move onto a GOOD life where there is always proper care and love.  The last photo of her is her intake photo :-(  Approximate Date of Birth is 04/27/20\n\nThe adoption donation is $200.     (please note that are dogs and puppies are fixed-not just vaccinations)\n\nALL DOGS ARE SPAYED/NEUTERED, UP TO DATE ON AGE APPROPRIATE VACCINATIONS, BORDATELLA, WORMED WITHIN THE LAST 6 MONTHS, AND MICROCHIPPED.  DOGS OVER THE AGE OF 9 MONTHS HAVE BEEN TESTED FOR HEARTWORMS, ANY OTHER KNOWN MEDICAL ISSUES TREATED OR NOTED.

We may not have an answer to your specific question.  The dogs in our care come from all kinds of situations.  Almost all of our volunteers hold full time jobs.

An appointment time will be set up after we receive your application and approve you.  If you do not hear back from us in 48 hours, please email again.  You can find the application on www.dogitdigitrescue.com or you may email us to have one sent to you.

I got the name because I am a female husky/ lab mix with beautiful blue eyes and the softest fur EVER!  My foster dad wanted to call me Cinnabon because I am soft and fluffy and colored just like a delicious cinnamon roll. I LOVE belly rubs and will pat you with my paw to encourage you to check out that soft fur in just the right place.   I am about 2 years old and am fully vetted and housetrained and very well behaved in the house. While I am crate trained, I do prefer stretching out on a cool floor on a hot day or on the sofa if I get the chance. The best thing is a sofa AND belly rubs. I would love to just hang out with you and snuggle up.  I generally walk well on a leash though I am still learning my manners when meeting up with other dogs. I like to bark at them and pull on my leash which I am learning is NOT the way to make friends and find a playmate. I really want to say hello and play but have this urge to show that I am top dog and the boss in our street.  I would love a home with a fenced yard to run and play in.  I am not scared of thunder or things that go bang in the night. I am treat motivated but it has to be the right treat at the time as I can be very picky about my food.\n\nI understand basic commands and enjoy working for my preferred treats but my favorite is having ear and belly rubs or just hanging out.  I do LOVE car rides. Head to the garage and call me and I will be there hopping in with no problems. If I want something I will whine to get attention or come and swat you with my paw.  Let my fosters know if you would like more information or to come and see me. I am in Lake Wylie SC.  \n\n\n",

She is a loveable girl who craves lovings and pets. If you stop, she will talk to you and ask you for more! She loves to be with her people, she doesn't like to be left alone outside. We suspect her birthday to be around February 2019.\n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

She was recently brought back to SHS after being in a home for almost a year, where she was very much loved. But due to a lifestyle change, they had to give her up. \n\nShe is at SEATTLE HUMANE SOCIETY so please contact them directly at  https://www.seattlehumane.org/. \n\nREPLIES TO THIS POSTING WILL NOT BE SEEN OR RESPONDED TO. \n\nAudrey has mellowed quite a bit in the last year, and has much better leash manners, greeting manners, and is all around more docile. She is still her happy, excited self, but doesn\u2019t get nearly as rambunctious when she meets new people and dogs. \n\nShe has had a variety of dog friends on campus, but we feel she needs to be the only pet in the home. While with us now, she\u2019s seen dogs on leash and hasn\u2019t been reactive. She has shown excitement, but not aggression, and she could have dog friends in the future with careful intros. \n\nShe is so sweet, playful, loving and cuddly! She thinks she\u2019s a lap dog sometimes and loves the water too! Audrey would do best with teens or older kids in the home too. Medically, Audrey is overweight and has hypothyroidism, so is on meds for that, along with some anti-anxiety meds to help with her shelter stress. \n\nAudrey really needs a chance!! \n\nShe is at SEATTLE HUMANE SOCIETY so please contact them directly at  https://www.seattlehumane.org/. \n\nREPLIES TO THIS POSTING WILL NOT BE SEEN OR RESPONDED TO.",

The adopter is the alpha member of the pack, and the dog or puppy needs as much one-on-one contact with the alpha as possible. For this reason, all Route 66 Rescue Inc. dogs are adopted to inside homes only. They must be on leash, or inside a secure fence when outside, and not left outside alone when no one is home. Invisible fencing does not qualify as protection since other animals and strangers have access to the dog. The dogs must be returned to Route 66 Rescue, Inc. if ever given up by the adopter. Thank you for understanding we want only the best for the dogs you give a forever home.\n\nSienna is a beautiful red girl.  She is energetic and eager to please.  We think she is about three years old.  On 8/31/2020, she weighed 60.8 lbs.  Sienna will be a great dog for an active, adult forever family.  Her adoption fee is $200.\n \nPlease complete and return the adoption application to meet Sienna, or any of our adoptable dogs.\nhttp://www.route66rescueinc.com/adoption-application.html Thank you for visiting our site.

She came to SHS from a shelter down in Southern WA back in March 2020. She was brought in as a stray and was very shut down and scared but after a few days of staff working with her, she began to warm up! \n\nShe is at SEATTLE HUMANE SOCIETY so please contact them directly at  https://www.seattlehumane.org/. \n\nREPLIES TO THIS POSTING WILL NOT BE SEEN OR RESPONDED TO. \n\nShe has been in a variety of different foster homes where we have learned a lot about her. Cha Cha is fear reactive to new people and other dogs. She has a high prey drive for small animals such as rabbits, squirrels, birds, cats, etc. She is VERY smart and learns super quick, but needs someone that understands her breed along with able to continue working on her socialization to people. She dog tested fine at her previous shelter with other dogs and has done ok with some dogs that she\u2019s met here, but she can be reactive on leash. \n\nCha Cha needs to be the only dog in the home and will need secure fencing. She LOVES toys, and because she is so darn smart, training with toys as a motivator is a great an option for her! \n\nShe is very sweet, loving and cuddly when she\u2019s comfy and warms up to you! She loves to be on laps, couches, playing with toys, out exploring and chilling in backyards. She\u2019d make a wonderful dog for someone who lives a bit more rural, has a fenced yard and no other pets. \n\nWe think she\u2019d best with teens or older kids in the home. Medically, Cha Cha is healthy, but she is an anxious dog, thus she is on some anti-anxiety meds. This girl is a smart cookie and just needs someone to give her a chance! \n\nShe is at SEATTLE HUMANE SOCIETY so please contact them directly at  https://www.seattlehumane.org/. \n\nREPLIES TO THIS POSTING WILL NOT BE SEEN OR RESPONDED TO. \n",

She is good with other dogs, \nalthough not completely comfortable around new dogs until she gets to \nknow them. No aggression, just not the kind of dog that wants to go \nbouncing into the dog park and meet everybody that she sees LOL. She \nis really good with people, seems fine with children, not a hug fan  of \ncats. I don\u2019t think that she has seen a lot of love in her life, but she is \nmore than ready to not just experience it but give it right back. I would \nlove to see her in a home as an only dog where she can be showered \nwith attention and love her family back 100%.\n\nLove Shack Dog Rescue\nChantilly, VA 20152\n\nCall, Text, Sabrina at 703-505-3758 \nEmail is sdroescher@yahoo.com \nThese are all good loving dogs who need a forever home, Help us Save them",

Unfortunately due to irresponsible breeding, this cutie does show signs of possible neurological issues. He will be looking for a special home who can manage his needs and love him just the way he was intended to be. Little Jack is leash trained and trustworthy with free roam as he knows not to chew. He does bark to alert like any good boy would, and will dig if bored. Jack has never met a stranger and loves all people and animals. This playful boy will be further evaluated as to his medical needs, but just know you\u2019ve never seen a more adorable punk in a doggie diaper! Jack does show an abnormal tail, has his own swagger of a gait, and is incontinent...but if you have experience with special needs pups, he\u2019s your guy! He does not allow his uniqueness to stand in his way, and hopes his new family see all his potential as well! Could this fluff bucket be your next best friend?\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

Cecil was surrendered to a county shelter by his owner because the apartment manager found out he was there. This is such a sad story that we hear over and over. Poor Cecil didn\u2019t do anything to deserve to lose his home, he was just born a pit bull. Luckily, we at SHR just LOVE pit bulls so we had to bring him back with us! Aside from being handsome, Cecil is sweet, polite, and knows some basic commands. He loves to lay in the baby pool at the shelter and will jump in and out throughout his play time. He\u2019s good with other dogs, but isn\u2019t super playful, he really just enjoys laying outside and getting attention from people. We believe he is housebroken because he has no accidents in his kennel. Cecil is loving, funny, and athletic... and just look at that smile! He is great company and will make a good companion during morning walks. Although he\u2019s capable of hiking, he\u2019d just as well cuddle on the sofa and spend time with his person watching TV. Cecil is everything you could ask for in a 70-pound package! If our sweet boy sounds like a good fit for your life, please fill out an application to get things started.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/91891552799173\n",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

Because I love treats so much, I do have a little bit of a sensitive stomach and do eat a special diet, but my friends will be happy to tell you more about it. I really like being the center of attention and would love a low traffic household with no other pets. I also prefer the company of adults as they are more sophisticated, just like me. My friends at the adoption desk ask that come and meet me multiple times before adopting me, just to make sure we are the best of friends! Please email them at adoption@lynchburghumane.org to schedule some appointments to meet me!",

I was lucky to be rescued from a breeding ring where life was not good and I feel the difference - I truly savor all that life now offers. I am meticulous in my habits; super clean and neat. I'm also very smart. I was the first of my canine associates here at the shelter to learn to sit, stay and heel and I'm the best at it (if I do say so myself) and I love a good walk. When available, i enjoy a warm dog bed by a fireplace. I would love to grace your home and heart with the tranquility and quietness of spirit that is my nature.",

Ada is house and crate trained, although she would rather not be crated. So far no accidents. We are working on leash manners and commands.\n\nAda needs an owner she can respect. In addition, she seems to have not been around other dogs.\u00a0She\u2019s fine with people, but doesn\u2019t know how to react to with dogs, so becomes anxious, which may seem aggressive to other dogs.\u00a0She does however have one best friend, Xena, who has gotten her to play and socialize.\u00a0They chase each other around the yard and have a great time. She tries to act like she doesn\u2019t like her, but her tail wags and she looks delighted.\u00a0So with proper introduction and work, she might be OK with another dog of the right temperament.\n\nAda is heartworm positive. We have started the slow-kill treatment for her, which is probably the best for her, given her high energy level and young age.\u00a0We will send all medications and directions with her.\n\nIf you think this lovely young lady would fit into your home please fill out an application.\u00a0\n\nLink to Application:\nhttp://www.gsdrescuectx.com/adoption-application.html\n",

FTTF is not liable for this dog and an adoption of this dog would be independent of FTTF. All courtesy posts are spayed/neutered.\nBreed: Pit Bull TerrierGender: FemaleEstimated Date of Birth: January 2, 2012Size: 60 lbsLocation: Atlanta, GA\nAdoption Fee: $150\nBella is an incredibly loving, sensitive, and attentive companion. She really wants nothing more than to please and is super engaged when challenged with new tricks. She's very food motivated and highly trainable, so much so that she would likely be successful and have a great time with agility training.\nAlthough Bella is 8 years old, she is still very playful and active; she's really just a puppy at heart. She is extremely curious, loves to sniff around, play tug, and (for some reason), jump up on any wall she sees. She hasn't quite mastered fetch just yet, but she would love you to teach her! She is content to roll around in the grass and explore new areas, but at home, she's a an excellent snuggle-bug as she loves to cuddle and be close to her person. Bella is a pretty mellow lady, but is really up for anything - she's ready to relax with you or zoom around the yard. Her pittie head-tilt is one for the record books and will melt the heart of any onlooker. She has some really hilarious sleeping positions and often smiles in her sleep.\nAll around, Bella is an amazing dog and would make a wonderful addition to a family where she can be the only pet. She has some fear-based reactivity that doesn't make her the best candidate for a stroll in a city park, but she would love a fenced yard to call her own and people she can bond with.\n*Friends to the Forlorn is assisting in the placement of Bella. If you are interested in adopting this boy, please contact us for more information!",

            "description": "Sitting pretty for her glam shots, sweet Fiona is as loveable as she is lovely.  This one and half year old Pit Bull mix is a friend to all and very affectionate.  She was surrendered after her owner moved and could no longer provide a suitable home.  Fiona is a young healthy dog that likes to have fun and needs a fenced in yard with room to run around.  She would love to have a family that will take her on walks and play games with her.  She\u2019s a solid fifty three pounds of muscle too.  Fiona is a good match for someone who enjoys a full active lifestyle and has the time to spend with her.  She would love to go running with you or go hike in the park.  She loves children but it would be best if they were older because of her large size.  Amiable and outgoing, Fiona does well with other dogs that enjoy rough and tumble play.  She would also be perfectly content as the only dog in the home.  Fiona is big on hugging and wants to be near you.  She craves companionship but is not overly needy.  She will entertain herself with toys or chew bones if you\u2019re too busy to play.  Fiona prefers to do her business on grass but will need some supervision when she first comes home.  It won\u2019t take her long to adapt if you keep to a consistent schedule.  Fiona is eager to please and very responsive to praise; especially if she gets a treat!  She is a devoted dog with a huge heart and so much love to give.  Come see for yourself!  To adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Liz at elizabethg@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Koda\nEstimated Breed : Lab/Bulldog Mix\nApproximate Age: 1-2 years\nApproximate Weight: approx. 54 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nKoda is a sweetheart with a striking orange coat of fur. He is in the kennel hoping that he will be the next to find his forever home and family. He is very strong so no young children, he may knock them down. Koda will do best as an only dog and would love a home with a fenced yard to run in.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Vince Vaughn is a 3 to 5 year old lab pointer mix. This guy is definitely large and in charge. He's one of our more challenging dogs. He's not a fan of getting a physical exam and had to be muzzled for a routine vaccinations and heartworm test. He's quite happy and charming around people when he doesn't have to do anything that he doesn't want to do, but if pushed, will growl and become a bit of a handful. Vince needs a very dog savvy owner who is willing to provide the necessary training and behavioral rehabilitation to make him a good addition to their house. He does get along with other dogs as long as they tend to be submissive to him. We know there's a home out there for events, but we need to make sure it's the right one for him and his new family. Based on the behavioral concerns, we are recommending a home with no children younger than 16 years of age. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; SCPR believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.doitforthedogs.com. We are the Second Chance Pet Rescue in Grove, OK. 918-786-7630.

It was scary and stressful but at least they have each other. Enrique (black and tan) is probably around 11 years old and Boon (tan) around around 7 years old, and weigh 7 pounds each. They are the best of friends and hate being away from each other - they are good with dogs, love people and sleep together in their crate at night snuggled up. We would love to find them a forever home together. They are a two in one package and are as easy as one dog. Could you be their forever home?\n\nIf you are interested in meeting  please fill out an application at our website www.gobeyondrescue.org/adopt. Our adoption fee is $350/dog and includes spay/neuter, microchipping and up to date vaccines. We Adopt in the SF Bay Area Only.",

Dale came to us with a front leg that was mangled from an old injury that hadn't healed correctly. The vet advised amputation and he adapted quickly to having three legs, since he hadn't really been relying on his injured leg for some time. He gets around quite well and can even go up and down stairs, but he does tire out fairly easily, especially in the heat. He'd love to have his own fenced-in yard where he could run around with a toy and then plop down in the shade, next to his person, and watch the dragonflies buzz by. \n\nDale is a lovebug who thinks he is a lap dog, he's got some puppy energy and doesn't always know his own size, so his perfect family would be with adults or older children. We'd like to find him a home without other pets. While he enjoyed playing with dogs in the past, he lost a bit of confidence in his interactions post-surgery, and he's working on some training to get back on track. Dale is really ready to flourish and just wants a stable home with a family that will support him and help him become his best self! If you are ready to be Dale's hero and discover what a lovable pup he is for yourself, fill out our pre-adoption application at https://oneloveanimalrescue.com/pre-adoption-application/ and we'll introduce you!",

            "description": "** FOSTER NEEDED: CURRENT FOSTER HAS GIVEN US TILL FIRST OF MARCH TO F IND A NEW SPOT FOR HER. NO PLACE TO GO AND WE NEED COMMITMENT UNTIL WE GET THE RIGHT ADOPTER. TEMP FOSTER PUTS A DOG I JEOPARDY. WE CANNOT SLAP DASH PLACE A DOG OR MANUFACTURE AN ADOPTER. WE MATCH DOGS WITH ADOPTERS. HAPPY IS A LEASH PULLER AND SHE IS NOT GOOD WITH OTHER DOGS BUT A LOVE OF A COMPANION DOG WITH HER PEOPLE AND LOVES KIDS\n\nIF THIS GIRL appeals to you please go to our website and fill out our online adopt app. There is no obligation to adopt if she isn't the right match but this is where we should start to find that out. ALso See her videos on our FB page.  \n\nSTATS: Happy is about a year and a half spayed female teenage puppy. She is a Koolie X ACD (Heeler) X Catahoula mix. Up to date on vaccs, HW tested and Negative, on Heartguard monthly prevention. On topical Frontline tick and flea meds. Weighs 44.6 pounds. She is a leash puller but she has toned it down a lot. Loves the water, and even obsessed with. She is a bit wild with car travel but has improved. Remember she is still very much a tri working breed puppy that is full of herself. She wants to go after anything moving, it often a game. She is needing slow introductions with strangers handling her like at the vets office. So for the sake of time constraints and safety they muzzled her for a brief period on her last vet visit. She did ok with the muzzle and the foster home has a muzzle they use only when absolutely necessary, mostly in trying to improve dog interaction. Crate broke to open wire crate. She is so good with ball playing and she is so fun and loves it and kids play fetch with her. The foster family introduces her to strangers by letting them play ball with her after the initial slow introduction and her warming up a bit to them. Like most working breeds, she is one family one pack oriented. Microchipped  She is a very vocal dog. She is happy, hence her name. She is respectful in the home and she listens and then remembers. Takes correction well. She needs a strong leader not a boss. Someone she can trust that has confidence. She does not beg for food at the table. All her issues are social, not stubbornness or unwillingness or testy. Very respectful in the home. She is a very needy dog for her pack social interaction so she is a good companion dog and family dog in the making. \nHISTORY: She was a stray to begin with. She was a puppy in a home that was not suitable for her, had little socialization and then a good Sam took her in and the husband wasn\u2019t happy because he wasn\u2019t consulted so she to go and came into rescue. They tried her with other dogs and another owner and it didn\u2019t pan out, it wasn\u2019t done properly but they didn\u2019t know that. They did their best. Then she went to a foster for rescue and the foster used shocking devices on her after being told it was not acceptable. She was then moved to another foster and they have done an awesome job turning some things around. The shocking device left burn marks on her neck but those have healed. However, it did its work as usual and we see the problems because dogs remember when they have been hut. The result of shock collar use is still being dealt with as far as behavior issues and she needs more time and patience to work through that and the fact that she is 3 working breeds adds to the mix. The reason she isn\u2019t being adopted by the current fosters is because they have dogs she doesn\u2019t get along with, (also part of the shock collar residuals, also they have a lot of company and with fires and with Covid and such, it is just pretty impossible for it to work well for them to keep her. They have done an amazing job so far with helping her along)   \n\nGOOD: Loves to play ball. She loves kids but she is large and puppy awkward and wild at times. Absolutely zero aggression with kids. Loves them. She is extremely affectionate and she can\u2019t get enough love and be close enough to you. Once she gets acquainted she is very cuddly and affectionate. Loves the water. Very smart and eager to please, very trainable, extremely food motivated and rewards with affection and ball too, so easy to teach tricks and agility in a back yard. She has no interest in going off to play she won\u2019t run away or bolt, she just wants to be with her people. She is not a very independent dog, she is Velcro dog. \n\nBAD: She is people cautious like most working breeds. She is manageable with caution and slow introductions. Fosters are careful with introductions. She is less friendly or slow to get acquainted with men over women. Tall people also are a bit of a trigger but manageable. She is pack protective and that is not uncommon with working breeds but adopters need to be aware of it. Her senses as to what is a threat is not clear. She is a baby and a teenager pup and no socialization properly so she still needs work on her judgements. She probably needs more exercise right now as well. More exercise seems to tone her down. She is moderately food possessive but gaining on it (ADMIN NOTE: We in rescue know how to work on that and can progress that and even get beyond that and will give help to a new adopter if needed). She is stimulated by cars passing the car she is riding in, and bike riders, runners: Mostly she barks and it is a mix of excitement and being protective. Normal for 3 working breeds in one dog and puppy. We see it often. \n\nUGLY: She does not like dogs period. Her prey drive is high so no small critters whatsoever for her in her new home. This will be the biggest challenge. It has been tested and this is absolute for her success in a new home. She must be accepted as she is with these limitations. \n",

            "description": "Tucker is a 6 year old double Merle Aussie. He was born blind and deaf but full of love and that smart Aussie spirit! Tuck was surrendered by his owner through no fault of his own in August 2020 and has been fostered in Michigan since then. It\u2019s hard to call Tucker disabled because he does such an amazing job navigating his surroundings but he certainly is special! He has an amazing sense of smell that can alert him to visitors up to 100 yards away (observed by his foster mom) and he insists on meeting those visitors promptly with a sniff. He loves everyone and will hop when especially excited to greet people. Interestingly, it\u2019s been noted by his foster parents, that Tucker gets very excited when meeting humans who also have special needs such as a foster uncle with intellectual disabilities and a family friend with physical disabilities. \n\nTucker is very easy to fall in love with but in the beginning he can be tricky to live with. For that reason he needs a home and family that are ready to make a commitment to him with the understanding that the first several weeks may be rocky. This may mean making changes to what the humans are used to in order to be flexible for Tucker. When he is adjusting to new surroundings he can be very vocal and this has caused him to be returned by potential adopters. A deaf blind dog can easily get their days and nights mixed up and due to their limited senses are very sensitive to change. He thrives on routine having a specific bed and bedtime routine and activity during the day. He is used to being kenneled when humans are gone but will not tolerate being locked in the kennel once you are home. When Tucker is unsettled he barks, a lot. His endurance in barking should not be underestimated and should be prepared for until he settles and adjusts. He is great with cats and loves other dogs however he does not follow the other dogs cues and this has often led to them becoming aggressive with Tucker. It\u2019s recommended he is the only dog or with another that is very accepting, laid back and patient. Tucker can walk on a leash when he\u2019s in the mood to but for routine potty breaks and exercise he requires a fenced in area. He is happiest having free roam of the house during the day when humans are home and will not tolerate being limited to one room. He can manage stairs and is trained via mats for texture and knows several tap signals. \n\nHis nose and love of extra food (he\u2019s a big boy weighing in at about 85 pounds) can get him into mischief like opening cabinets with his teeth when seeking an extra treat! His hobbies include running circles when he\u2019s bored and occupying the couch with or without the humans to snuggle, but he\u2019d prefer with. Tucker can be a lot of work but every ounce you put into him he will give back in love and companionship over time. He will be a faithful and diligent guard (that nose again)! for the right home. \n\n If you think Tucker is a good fit for you, please fill out our application:\nhttps://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application",

Like I seriously love people no matter their size. I'm such a good girl! I know to go potty outside and I even walk pretty well on the leash if I do say so myself. I'm also crate trained but I'd honestly rather lounge on the couch while you're gone. I get awfully jealous of other animals so prefer to be pampered solo and be an only child smothered with love and toys! It may sound a bit conceded but I have the best personality and love to talk to you with my little howls. People call be goofy but I think charismatic is a nicer way to put it.\nTo adopt me, please apply at www.hhfrescue.org.\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

Ideally, they would be placed together in a home that can give this energetic duo plenty of exercise! They need some leash work, but know sit, down, and no. They also seem to be housebroken. Their former owner said they don't care for smaller dogs, especially ones that might be too \"in their face.\" They currently are living with a larger hound mix and a Chihuahua/terrier mix and have done well with both of their foster siblings. Shilling loves squeaky toys, and will happily rip one to shreds in her dog bed. Her brother, Six, is more laid back and submissive. Per their prior owner, they have done fine with cats, but in their foster home, they did intensely bark and corner the cat. Homes with cats would likely need to be evaluated on a case by case basis, as any cats would likely need to be larger and \"dog-savvy.\" Both terriers are altered, up to date on vaccines, and heartworm negative.\n\nWww.russellrescue.com/adoption\n\nPlease follow the above link to apply for adoption for Shilling and Sixpence.",

One of our fosters went to go get pictures of the puppies and the mama but she couldnt get near the mama. We took all the puppies into the rescue and it took our foster 6 days to be able to catch mama. All the puppies have been adopted and now its mamas turn!! June is a 2-3 year old girl, weighs about 50 pounds, up to date on shots and spayed. She is super smart and very sweet. She is crate trained, house trained and knows how to use the dog door. She loves to sleep on the bed with the humans but loves playing with her foster brothers even more!",

            "description": "\"All I want for Christmas is a Home!\"\nSnicker has a brother, Doodle, that found his forever home for Christmas.  Snicker is about 6 months old and may have a little Min Pin or Dachshund in his genes and weighs 15 lbs. He and his brother were saved from Mexico. Snicker knows basic commands of sit, come, shake, and he knows how to use a doggy door. If you are looking for a \"lap dog\" this is your guy! He loves to snuggle and will curl up beside you on the couch/chair and fall fast asleep.\n\nFilling out an application is the first step in the adoption process. If you have questions, the best way to contact us is to email azdesertrottis@aol.com.\n\nWe don't always bring all animals to our adoption events so check ahead of time to make sure the animal you are interested in is still available. Some animals listed may already be promised.\n\nArizona Desert Rottie & Pals Rescue is a NO KILL rescue serving Tucson and the surrounding area. \n\nA home visit is usually required for the safety of our animals. We check the yard to make sure this little pup cannot escape, no predator can get in, and also look for hazardous plants. \n\nWe do not adopt our dogs out unless you have a secure, fenced yard, it\u2019s a requirement for the safety of the dog. At the end of the application, please include the type of fencing and the height of the fence you have around your yard. \n\nIf you're interested in Snicker or any of our dogs, please fill out a pre application at: http://www.azdesertrotti.com/html/to_adopt.htm\nOnce you have filled out the pre-adoption application, someone will contact you about the dog to answer your questions and tell you where our Sunday adoption event is held.\n\nOur dogs are bathed, dewormed, vet checked, given their required shots, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. \n\nOur rescues are homed with foster parents. They are fostered in homes so that we can tell you a little bit about their personalities, feeding schedule, habits, behavior, whether they get along with other dogs. We can tell you if they are crate trained, if they are leash trained and house trained. Most dogs need a refresher course on potty training when they go to a new home. They need to learn your routine, and it will be up to you to teach them. \n\nEven the most abused animals can be wonderful pets. It takes patience, love and good food, along with fun and commitment to the animal. Fosters work with these animals. They are a part of our families, while we are lucky enough to have them.",

Well... her nub of a tail anyway, which always seems to be vibrating a million miles an hour from happiness or excitement. \n\nShe\u2019ll hate getting out of bed in the mornings as much as you do, and keep you company in the office while you work remotely. She\u2019s very good at reading the room, whether you\u2019re in need of a laugh, a friend, or a comforting snuggle. She knows \u2018Sit,\u2019 \u2018Lay Down,\u2019 \u2018Shake,\u2019 \u2018High Five,\u2019 \u2018Off,\u2019 \u2018Place,\u2019 and \u2018Bang.\u2019 She is leash/collar trained and does fine in a kennel. \n\nRipley is a wonderful dog in need of a great home. \n\nShe is approx 2 years old, 60 lbs and heartworm negative.

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nClaudia is a pretty mellow girl.  Around 8 years old.  She loves to take a nap after breakfast in the warm sun!  She gets along well with her 5 furmates.  Not totally house broke but is learning to use pee pads.  She prefers to sleep under the covers on the bed!\n\nClaudia has undergone treatment for heartworm and is ready for her own home!  Her new home needs to commit to year round heartworm preventatives for the rest of her life due to her treatment.   This will cost around $8 dollars per month.   \n\nDuring her heartworm treatment we have been watching Claudia's lungs, and xrays that were just done and sent to a radiologist show that her lungs have improved from the last time we did xrays.  She is currently on doxycycline and will likely have a slight cough for the next few weeks up to a few months as her lungs continue to heal.   Claudia's adopter needs to be willing to continue on with any follow up needed on this.  \n\nClaudia is spayed and had a recent dental, she is up to date on vaccinations, microchipped,  and current on preventatives. \n\nAdoption fee is $350 + tax (no checks) \n\nFoster to contact: Tami  @    tami.reed1227@gmail.com\n\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

He loves running and romping with other dogs in our fenced exercise areas.  He never meets a stranger and enjoys going for leash walks with our volunteers.\n\nHe is full-grown weighing 44 pounds.\n\nZinger is a great dog and promises years of love and friendship! Do you have room in your home, heart and life for this big lovebug?\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

Inside the home, he shines as an obedient, very intelligent, clean, loyal, respectful, loving dog that is crate trained.\n\nPeanutbuddie is very alert outside the house, focusing on sights and sounds of prey.\n\nHe will go to great lengths to obtain his target, so he needs a high fence of at least 6 feet. He is playful, energetic, tracking prey and enjoys challenging games, his toys and running.\n\nPeanutbuddie is relaxed with those he has observed for several days, but looks constantly for cues in those he doesn't know yet, sometimes misreading their intentions. So, it is best if he is not placed in a home with children or in settings with active newcomers.\n\nPeanutbuddie has good potential for a rural area or fenced in large area where he is free to guard his domain from critters that enter. He enjoys using his incredible smell and sight, and the outside stimulates his imagination.\n\nHis foster family sees that he can be aggressive with cats. Neighborhood children walking their dogs nearby may overly excite him.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

She is a typical smart, eager terrier and is learning all the things she needs to know to be a great companion!  She's dog selective, but will do best in a home with a compatible playful, confident canine companion.  She's OK with dog-savvy cats.  She still has a lot of nervous energy, but is learning to channel it into playing with her dog friends, going for walks, snooping around outside, etc  She's housetrained, crate trained, and leash trained.  She will do best with a terrier-savvy person with rescue dog experience who'll be able to continue her training and socialization.  She's an active dog and would not be good in a home with small children or anyone unstable on their feet.  Patsy's adoption fee is $300.  LOCAL ADOPTION ONLY.\n\nThis dog may be at one of the Prescott pet stores on Sat. If you're interested, please call in advance to confirm that we're bringing this dog and where we'll be. Call for more info. 928 708-0799.\n\n",
