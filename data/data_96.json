Inquiries requesting additional information will not be returned, due to limited volunteers. Thank you for your understanding **** \n\nMeet Ginger.\n\nGinger was adopted from a local high kill shelter and returned because she is not good with small dogs and they had a small dog. NO small dogs or cats for this girl, however, she gets along great with male and female dogs her size with proper introductions.\n\nGinger is working on her leash manners and socialization outside of the home but does great in a crate, has great house manners, and loves to play outside with older kids and doggy friends! She loves people, and will cuddle up on the couch after an afternoon of playing in the yard. Ginger is very nervous outside of the home, obviously hasn\u2019t had much experience out in public. She would do best in a home as a house dog and not so much an out and about dog. \n\n\nHer adoption fee is $200, which includes her vaccinations, spay surgery, and microchip. We are located in Houston, TX, but she can also be transported to an approved adopter in WA for an additional  transport fee of $250.\n\nIf you would like to add Ginger to your family, you can fill out our adoption application here http://bit.ly/PRAdoption and we will be in touch soon!",

I need a home with a female only who is home most of the time and has experience with ultra skittish former puppy mill dogs. Having other dogs in the home really helps me learn how the household works.  \n\nI prefer to sleep in a dog bed.  I am unable to walk on a leash so access to a secure fenced in yard is a must.  Dog parks are not an option for me.  \n\nI consider the crate my safe space and don't mind being in there at all for reasonable amounts of time. If the door is left open, I will put myself inside to rest.\n\nI know how to use designated potty pads indoors and also know how to use my dog door.\n\nYouTube video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw45WiURJYQ",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks. Roshi's hobbies are sitting in the wading pool, drinking out of other people's water bottles, rolling in the mud, receiving tummy rubs and looking cute. He is a fun ball of energy that loves to play. Roshi has never seen a bad day and if you don't want to play, no problem, he will toss the ball to himself! He is a good boy but needs a home where he can enjoy playing and going on walks. He would probably be OK with a similar sized female dog but he's not a fan of littles or other boys. He should not live with children due to him being easily overstimulated and becoming mouthy. What you see is what you get with Roshi, his happiness is contagious!\n\nMeet handsome Roshi at Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA (open 10-5, 7 days)\n\nor email: apassionforpaws@gmail.com for adoption information.\n\nFollow us on Facebook:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/apassionforpaws/\n\nInstagram:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/apassionforpaws/\n\nTwitter:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/apassionforpaws\n\nVisit Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA, Open 10-5 daily BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

            "description": "Hi, my name is Luca!  If you have a quiet home and the time and patience to win over a wary dog, then I have a match for you.  I was born in November of 2019 and was brought back to the shelter because I'm a fearful dog and not a good fit for a family with kids.  Once I came back to the shelter, it took a long time for me to allow the staff to leash me and take me outside. I just do not know how to trust.  I now love to romp and play with the people I know. I've made some huge strides!  It is everyone's hope that I am given a chance to be comfortable in a home.  Please note that if you'd like to add me to your home, you'll need to make a couple of visits to the shelter to spend extra time with me prior to adoption.  Apply for me today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $60. Adoption applications can be filled out at CCHS or online through our website, www.cchs-petshelter.org. Applications are not first come, first served. All applications will be reviewed by the adoption committee and the home chosen will be the one considered to be the best match. All dogs and puppies have been vaccinated for Distemper and Bordetella, dewormed and microchipped. If old enough, they will be vaccinated for Rabies and blood tested for Heartworm, Lymes, Anaplasmosis and Erlichiosis. Dogs and puppies will be spayed or neutered before adoption.\n\nCCHS is proud to be a No-Kill Humane Society. As a private, non-profit charity, our work depends on donations and volunteers to keep going. We are committed to helping the animals that enter our doors and finding each the best possible forever home. CCHS has been inspected and licensed by the Department of Animal Health - DATCP. Our license is #268235-DS",

Johnny's confidence comes out when there's another dog to play with, so a home with a canine companion would be best for him. He also needs a fenced in yard, as he has not quite mastered the leash yet, and he really enjoys running around the yard with his doggy friends. Don't miss out on this sweet adult boy!

She is being treated for heartworms and her new family will need to continue that treatment but despite what may have been a rough start to life she is as sweet as they come. She loves a good back scratch or belly rub and will some lucky family a calm and devoted companion.",

Sorry, no exceptions.\n\n**\n\nAlder's adoption begins with a Foster-To-Adopt arrangement that continues until he has completed Basic and Intermediate Obedience Training.\n\n**\n\nMeet Alder, who was found protecting his tiny siblings (or maybe daughters?) Maple and Juniper where they were all been dumped in rural Arizona! He's SO FRIENDLY and funny, soft as silk (maybe part Pei?), and takes treats gently.\n\nAlder will thrive in a family with an adult who is home most of the time. He is young, yearns to please, and is very quick to learn! Dog-savvy children older than eight years, please, as he is small but runs fast and plays hearty!\n\nAlder loves people and his face lights up when he sees new humans and friendly dogs. He would love an active family that appreciates his sense of humor and fun. He is such a happy and delightful dog and absolutely craves companionship! Alder requires a fenced yard for frequent play and also because he is sometimes vocal when his humans are out of sight and he's feeling lonely!\n\nIf you believe you're a possible match for Alder, please complete an adoption application! Please include information about your experience with raising and training a puppy.\n\n\"Companion animal\" means, needs at least one other friendly, playful dog that lives full-time in the same household.\n\"Fenced yard\" means, a backyard that is adjacent to and connected with your residence. (It does not mean a nearby fenced area/dog park.)\nGates must have padlocks and thresholds (cement or buried pavers to prevent digging.)\nYard and patio must be free of debris and have room for dogs to run and play *on a lawn and/or in a very shaded area.* Please do not invite us to your home if you have not yet landscaped your yard!\n\"Swimming pool\" means a private, in-ground, year-round pool that is available to the dog daily or multiple times per week.\nWe do not place dogs in situations where there are \"drained\" or empty swimming pools, which are a fall hazard and contribute to the propogation of mosquitos.\nLast and not least, we DO NOT adopt to students as we have found that they often do not know or anticipate where life will take them.\n\nDiscussion about a dog - including scheduling of a home check or other dialogue - cannot occur until we have received your completed adoption application. NO EXCEPTIONS. Thank you!",

            "description": "Jake is a 1 year old handsome boy looking for his forever family. Jake is a mixed breed per a DNA test done and the results are that he is an awesome mix of English Setter (yes you heard that right English Setter) , American Staffordshire Terrier and Bull Staffordshire Terrier. Jake is all about a good time and loves to play and romp. He would make an excellent hiking or running partner. He is house broken, and crate trained, he loves to be where ever you are! He is good with other larger dogs, and kiddos. But would not like to share his world with smaller pets (small dog, cats etc) as he does have a prey drive which is very normal given his hunting dog heritage and all. Jake is up to date on shots, microchipped and will be neutered. If you are looking for a fun handsome fella to spend your days with and the sweetest kisses and cuddles at night Jake is your man.

            "description": "Meet Harlequin, or Quinn as he likes to be called. He is a 4 year old catahoula. Looking for a dog that would LOVE to go on a hike with you? Well then Quinn is your guy!\n\nQuinn's perfect match would be a family who lives in a house, since apartment living would not suit this large fella - he needs room to romp and play- it's his favorite pastime! A good sized 6ft privacy fence for his safety would be ideal.\n\nDue to Quinn's size (70lbs) and his playful demeanor he would be better matched to a home with older children 10 and up. While we are unsure of Quinn's feelings towards feline friends, we do know Quinn would be able to live with another doggie friend who is submissive and enjoys to play. Quinn has done fabulous with other dogs with slow and proper intros. He would love someone active as he loves to romp outdoors and to go for walks. He is great on a leash and wants to learn! He loves to cuddle but he is not a couch potato by any means.\n\nQuinn needs someone with large breed experienced who can be a confident and solid pack leader willing to work with him so he can be his very best. We promise you if you take a chance on Quinn he will pay you back tenfold. He truly is an amazing dog.\n\nPlease be sure you have the time, commitment and experience to dedicate to our sweet boy prior to filling out our adoption application. \n\nThe Catahoula is a breed of dog like no other. Extremely loyal and protective, a true diligent worker, and will be the best friend one could ask for. Exercise is a must or they will get unruly. \n\nDog ownership is a very serious commitment and it is one that should be for a lifetime. It is not something to dive into without a lot of thought and research.\n\nAdopt Quinn pawzabilitiespa.org/adopt\n\nFoster Quinn pawzabilitiespa.org/foster",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Sarah is 2 years old at the time of intake in August 2020. Sarah is good with people of all ages and other dogs. We pulled this sweet girl from a kill shelter where she was languishing most likely just days away from euthanasia due to a medical condition. Though only 2 years old, Sarah is suffering from heart failure which caused her belly to fill up with fluid. So even though she was completely emaciated, her belly was huge. Our veterinary partner drained the fluid from her belly and she is now on the medications she will require. Sarah is a happy couch potato/lap dog who is easily trainable as she is motivated by food and treats. Sarah deserves a chance to live a normal, happy life and we know we will find that special someone to be Sarah's \"person.\" If you are that amazing person willing to give Sarah the happy life she deserves, please apply online to adopt Sarah (GA) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Riley of Heavenly Angels is a very handsome 9 year old lab mix who is utd on vaccinations, neutered and microchipped.  He is housebroken and loves his crate. Riley is very attached to his bed and if you try and move it, he will chase you and jump on it so you can't move it, so cute!  Riley never destroys furniture or anything else and rarely barks.  Riley knows many tricks such as such as give paw, sit, down, stay, jump, and belly roll.  He is very low maintenance, likes his casual walks and is content to stay near you and is extremely loyal and protective of his human.  Riley likes slow introductions, not a lot of noise, and people who take their time to get to know him.  He does not like other dogs, is good around cats and no kids please \u2013 they are too busy for him.  We desperately need a new foster or better yet, a forever home for Riley.

That's a long time to be bouncing from home to kennel to foster and kennel again .\n\nPiggy earned her name due to her cute piggy sounds and ways. \n\nShe is a lovable girl, who also prefers the single life. She still has some trust issues that may make her a little hard to win over right away, but once she loves you ,you will be rewarded with an everlasting love ?? \n\nShe recently had major surgery to remove a  cancerous lump. It's time this girl finds a place to rest her head for good. \n\nPiggy responds well to commands and just wants to snuggle ,play, and eat snacks with her human.  \nDoes anyone have a place for this older gal to live the rest of her life in ? The rescue will provide training for her.  \nPlease email Harescue1@aol.com for more info or to fill out a foster or adoption app \nWww.heavenlyangelsanimalrescue.org. \nPlease share our Piggy girl ,or even better give her a chance.",

While I'm a mature chap, I still have plenty of energy. I need work on my leash manners and the nice staff here is working with me on those. I love running and playing in the yard and a home with a securely fenced yard would be awesome. I am good with other dogs of similar likes and energy and will make an easy addition to your heart and home. I'm not overly fond of baths. My previous owner did not have me on monthly heartworm prevention and now I am heartworm positive which makes me not feel so good. But thankfully the nice people here at BDRR are providing me with the life saving heartworm treatment that will make me healthy again. The nice people in Adoptions can explain all about the treatment process and how important monthly heart worm prevention is for us pups.",

Love short road trips.\nDo I snore: not really, but I snort like a pig sometimes\nBreed: American Staffordshire Terrier Mix\nHow are my manners: I am a super good girl. I listen very well, I sit, stay and lay down on command. I walk well on leash and am use to a harness. I play \"baby fetch\" and tug-of-war\nI am great with other dogs with proper introduction, cool with kids and am intrigued by cats. I love to sleep, chill, get belly rubs and snuggle. I am a pro at potty training and am ok in a crate for short periods. I do well at home alone and do not like to make a mess. I love play dates with my friends, doggie parks, road trips, warm baths, ears cleaned and massages. I am looking for a loving home with maybe another pup or cat. I am so sweet, pretty and we behaved that once you meet me, you'll love me.\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquiry about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

Once you are in his circle, he is the first to cuddle, and if there is a lap available, he's happy to keep it warm. He loves to play and explore too, but he gravitates a bit more quickly than his siblings to nap and cuddle time. He requires another small breed, confident and playful canine buddy in his forever home, and he has wonderful kitty manners too. Angus would love to have a family that includes him in all the fun that life has to offer, he'd love to bond with his new humans by attending a puppy class too!\n\nAll children in Angus' home must be 10 years of age or older. A fenced in yard (structured fencing) attached to the home, is also required so that he can continue to be successful in his house training, and be safe while exploring and exercising too. As with all young pups, Angus requires a home where his humans are not gone for long hours.",

He is known to follow his foster momma around the home, patiently waiting to see what the next adventure will be. He isn't a clingy boy, but he does like to cuddle. He is the quiet observer and thinker, who is always the first to sit for attention. He would love a home that enjoys going on walks and exploring. He would do best with another small breed, playful canine companion in the home. He is very appropriate with kitties too. Ansel is learning his basic obedience lessons, and would do best in a home that wants to continue training with him. He is crate trained, and rides well in the car too.\n\nAll children in Ansel's home must be 10 years of age or older. A fenced in yard (structured fencing) attached to the home, is also required so that he can continue to be successful in his house training, and be safe while exploring and exercising too. As with all young pups, Ansel requires a home where his humans are not gone for long hours.",

He would play fetch all day if he was allowed. Sinatra is barrier reactive in his kennel at the shelter so we are working with him and he is starting to improve greatly but because of this we are saying no children in a home with him. Sinatra needs a home with no other dogs. If you are interested in meeting Sinatra, the Humane Society at Lakewood Ranch is open Friday through Sunday 11:00 - 4:00. Any questions, contact us at info@hslwr.org. This is the source to for more information. Thank You!",

She prefers calmer and chill dogs to ones that are too hyper or yappy. She is better with dogs around her size (50lbs) or bigger. \n\nMatilda loves going on car rides and napping on the couch. She loves being around people and getting attention. Matilda is house broken and she is good around older children, may knock over small children unintentionally during play. She loves treats and would prefer if kids don't try to take treats or food away from her.\n\nMatilda needs a strong leader who can teach her what is acceptable behavior and what is not. She is smart and willing to learn.\n\nTo adopt, please fill out an adoption application at https://www.threepawsrescue.org/adoption-application/\n\nFor information about adoption fee, please visit https://www.threepawsrescue.org/adoption-fees/\n\nTo learn about the adoption process, please visit https://www.threepawsrescue.org/adoption-process/\n",

            "description": "Sebastian came to our shelter by way of our friends at Baldwin County Animal Control in Georgia. He ended up at the shelter when his owner passed away suddenly. Sebastian is about 2-3 years old and weighs about 50 lbs. \n\nSebastian was frightened by new people when he first arrived at our shelter. We have been working with him and he has made vast improvements. Sebby is the type of dog that will \u201cpick his people,\u201d so we require approved adopters to visit multiple times to build trust with him. \n\nSebastian MUST be adopted to a home with Chow (or akita/shar pei, shiba) experience.  There will be no exceptions.  He needs a quiet, adult home WITHOUT cats.  Once you win him over, he will be your best friend for life. Sebby gets along wonderfully with other dogs.  \n\nSebastian is neutered and vaccinated for Rabies, Distemper, and Bordetella. He tested negative for heartworm and is current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention too. Sebastian is also microchipped with a lifetime registration.\n\nTo meet Sebastian, please visit our website www.HalfwayHomeRescue.org to complete an adoption application. Adoption donation $450",

            "description": "Sanctuary Notes on Savanna: Savanna was nicknamed Smiley, as when she first came to us she would watch us with interest and a big smile on her face. She came in with a group of seven other pyrs from the neglectful situation described below. I thought for sure that she would be the first to warm up to us as she seemed to have the most confidence and did not seem as fearful as the others, but she would always keep her distance, playfully smiling at me from behind a tree. We now have them in an area with access to indoors and outdoors in our main building, where they are getting used to seeing us all throughout the day. We have found that although Savanna seems to be adventurous and inquisitive, she is still unwilling to let us actually pet her and will skip away last minute. Because of this we are going to switch gears and give her and Leo more undivided one on one attention to help her past this hurdle. She will happily stand at arms length from me, smiling and eat treats, but gets confused when we reach out to make physical contact as this was not likely the norm in her last \"home\" We have high hopes that we will have the needed breakthrough with Savanna, and would love a specific patient foster home to help her get there!\n\nGroup notes: Milo took in seven beautiful yet under-socialized Pyrenees that had been seized from a hoarding situation, but were then set for euthanasia due to lack of space at the shelter. We have been working with them to gain their trust as they were not raised as family members, and some are making great strides. Because of this, they are looking for very patient, understanding and rural homes that will continue to work with them to help them to realize their full potential. \n\nNone of these dogs have ever bitten anyone and even the most fearful will run and bark when scared or unsure of a situation rather than show outward aggression. They had not been raised walking on a leash and were living in a large fenced area together which they had never left and were used for breeding, cared for by a man with mental illness until seized by animal control for neglect. Because they were not raised with livestock ( and do show a prey drive towards cats) they would not be a good choice for someone looking to have them guard animals on a farm, and because they were not raised in a home, they do not understand commands etc, but they do prefer to go potty outside and are loving sleeping on cozy beds. They will follow direction when a routine is established and will go inside or out as a group when asked. They do love each other and will bound around and play, but we do not know how they would do with other dogs given that Pyrenees imprint with the animals that they are raised with and these guys can get worked up as a group when there is a dog unknown to them outside the fence, for this reason if there is another dog in the home their interactions would have to be closely monitored in order to make sure that they are a safe fit together. From what we have seen, they are open and excepting of puppies even if outside the family group, but again supervision would be key! If you are willing and able to help one of these gorgeous dogs, please send applications to foster or adopt to sanctuary@milofoundation.org\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog.\n\nOur Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioural issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments.\nThese are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. \nBUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioural \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

They only had each other when they were dumped in a rural area. Now Roxie has been adopted and Ringo is alone. He is still growing into his personality. \n\nRingo gets along with other dogs but would best be matched with a female. He is extremely athletic and a physical fence would need to be modified to contain him. An electric fence combination might be a good option. \n\nCurrently, he is almost 40 pounds. He will likely be 50-60 pounds when full grown. Ringo is a quiet and respectful guy with a keen sense of loyalty. He is very soft and likes to be a lap dog. He is happiest around the people he loves. \n\nIf you are interested in Ringo, you must fill out a pre adoption form found on our information page or our website. If we do not contact you in a few days, please reach out to us via email. Sometimes the applications don't come through. We are looking for the best match for Ringo.",

My name is Athena and I am a 6 year old Boxer and once had a family of my own. Suddenly my family abandoned me and I have been alone ever since. I have been lucky to have been rescued by Rockin P Rescue where I have now lived for almost a year. I am so thankful for Angie and her team but I am really sad not to have my own family anymore. I ask myself if I did something wrong that I needed to live at a rescue for so long, but I can\u2019t find and answer.\nA few things about me that I would like you to know. I love to play a LOT when I am able to get out of the kennel. If you stomp your feet at me I will get so excited and want to catch you. I love to run and jump around with the people that take time with me and play. I have gone on a lot of field trips to Encore Enrichment Center for Shelter Dogs to learn how to listen to commands. They say I do really well and listen to them like a champ! It makes me happy to know I can make humans happy so I try hard to learn as much as possible. They have told me that if someone adopts me they can bring me to Encore for two more free lessons so my human family can see how good I am and let me show off my listening skills.\nI do not like other dogs and some of the humans that have met me don\u2019t understand why. I am not sure either but we all have our own personalities and this one is mine. I would love to find a forever home with a family that only wants me in their life. I promise to love you so much and show you all the time. I want a human family so badly and wish someone would choose me to take home. I have seen so many other dogs come and go to new homes, but not me. I think it\u2019s because when they see me in my kennel there are other dogs around me so I bark at them and get a little nervous. Like I said earlier, when I am out of my kennel and just around humans I am relaxed and like to play with them and just have fun being a Boxer.\nIf you are thinking about adopting an \u201conly\u201d dog please remember me and imagine how happy you could make me. I super paw promise to give you love in return and will never let you forget what a great thing you did by rescuing me.\n\nThis dog is being fostered near Jacksonville, AL. You must be willing to drive part if not all of the way to pick up this dog for adoption unless transportation to another state has been arranged.  Please contact us with any questions. \n\nPlease visit Rockin' P Rescue, Inc. to submit an online adoption application. \n\n\nAdoption contributions are as follows: \n* $300.00 for a dog 6 months and under\n* $250.00 for a dog aged 7 months to 1 year \n* $225.00 for a dog over one year",

            "description": "Kavik is an Alaskan Husky mix and is a very loving dog who found himself at the Wichita Animal Shelter. He's a bit nervous meeting new people but warms up quickly and has no problem cuddling with you if you if you can keep his attention. He has tons of energy, so an active family is a must for him. IHe is great with the kids ages 6&10 in his current foster home, but needs to work on social skills. He wants to say hello to every animal but comes off as a little too eager/intrusive when given the chance to say hi. He wants to be an alpha so he can be persistent about shows of dominance with other dogs. He has little interest in playing fetch. He is a great running companion but needs some work to slow down on walks (gentle leader works ok but it bugs him). He is mostly house trained. He has been kenneled when he can't be watched and shows signs of separation anxiety when he's left alone. He has only had a couple of accidents inside the house. He has a scar on his right cheek and left front leg for reasons unknown. He does know some common commands like sit and come and is very food driven. He is a fast eater but hasn't shown too much protective actions towards people getting close while he's eating. He does not like being pulled by his collar by your hand (maybe a trigger from past human aggression?) but is ok when its done with a leash. Overall he is a great dog that just needs a little training and a family who will love him and love to be active with him.",

She is good with other dogs, cats, and older children. She came to us after her owner passed away. She was covered in flees and had no hair on her back or tail. The hair on her back has grown back in however our vet feels that the hair on her tail may never come back in because the hair follicles were likely damaged because of her chewing constantly. She is a super sweet girl who is looking for a home to spend her retirement years.",

She loves being around people and is very protective of her humans. Aperol adores her canine foster sister so she really needs a home with another playful dog. She is a total people pleaser who wants nothing more to make her humans happy. She is also house trained. She is also very curious about her surroundings and will find even the tiniest openings in fencing, so needs to be kept very secure and safe and always supervised when outdoors because she can be an escape artist. Aperol does have some leash aggression and separation anxiety so she needs someone that has the time to work with her on this.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

She could use some manners training, as she does like to jump, but this is easily corrected since she is very praise and treat motivated. \n\nWE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING BY APPOINTMENT ONLY DUE TO COVID-19\nUnless otherwise stated, the adoption fees for dogs over 5 months range from $50-$175. Puppies under 5 months are $175.00. Cats over 1 year are $35.00, kittens under 1 year old are $60.00. Dog adoption fees include a microchip. Cats can be microchipped by request for an additional $5.00.\nThe adoption fee includes the animal's surgery, vaccinations, flea preventative, deworming medication, sample bag of food/treat samples and a free first exam with participating veterinarians. Shelter policy and 2018 Indiana state law decrees all animals must be spayed or neutered prior to leaving the shelter.\nWE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING BY APPOINTMENT ONLY DUE TO COVID-19\nOur shelter is open to the public on Monday- Saturday from 8:00 am -5:00 pm EST with the exception of Wednesdays on which we typically open by 1:00 pm. If you would like to make an appointment to meet one of our many adoptable animals, please send an email to us at pvchs@joink.com. To apply to adopt, you may download an adoption application from the Applications and Fees tab on our website. The web address is www.pvchs.cfsites.org.

            "description": "Calliope aka Cat\n\nLocated in Sidney NE\n1 year old approximately \nShar Pei and Bulldog Fusion \nVERY Dog friendly \nNOT cat friendly \nNOT good with small kids (conflicting reports on this) but I think she would be just fine with older kids \nSlow to warm up to new ppl especially men\nHouse trained\nCrate trained and knows a couple basic commands\nWas the more shy of her and her sister but she's a super outgoing, playful and silly girl now\nFully vetted\n50lbs (she's very solid, kinda like a bulldog)\n\nCat aka Callope was found with her sister Tullulah when they were babies. These 2 girls were found by a private citizen rescuer dumped on the Mexico/TX border. The finder kept them and eventually listed them for rescues or adoption however no one was interested. She had them a YEAR when we happened to see their posting. The rescuer actually got Covid and almost died, she is still fighting and has a lot of residual medical issues from it. This sweet woman and these girls needed help. They are not in any way \"aggressive\" just scared, when joining new households, which is pretty expected. Cat LOVES to play with other dogs, she has excellent recall and she loves to cuddle! Cat was attacked by other dogs as a puppy so her left jowls are shorter than her right, but she is seriously the sweetest girl! This little bowling ball and Pei combo is so truly unique and so crazy sweet we are certain her people are out there waiting for her! \n\nIf you think those \"people\" may be you please contact us!!\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our voicemail at (402)957-1578\n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee Each (however our main concern is finding a home(s) that fit for these girls\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

            "description": "Meet Cookie!  Her name should be bubbles because that is her favorite game. Cookie will chase bubbles all day. Cookie is about 3 years old. She is a lovable mix breed female. All her shots are up to date and she is spayed. She is looking for a forever home ready to accept all the love she has to give. She loves to cuddle on the couch with you and will not wake you up at 5am to eat. Cookie likes to sleep in. She is house broken but is very talented at getting out of a crate. She would be best in a house without cats. She does ok with other dogs but likes attention so an only animal house would be ideal. She does well with kids and would do well in a house with school age kids and older. Cookie gets very excited when kids are playing and wants to get in the middle of the action.  She walks well on a leash and does well on car rides. She is a very easy going dog. She is not a jumper unless you let her, but we encourage her not to jump up on people when greeting them. She loves a tennis ball but not the best at giving them back. She has mastered sit and shake. Do you have room on your couch and your lap for Cookie who is so full of love?\n\nAre you interested in adopting Cookie or another JCAPL pet you have seen? You'll need to start by completing an adoption application, available online at our website: www.jcapl.org. There is no obligation to adopt by completing an application, however, we do recommend submitting an application as soon as you find an animal you are interested in. We review applications in the order they are received.\n\nCompleted applications can be sent via email to adopt@jcapl.org , faxed to 919-300-5524 or delivered in person by visiting us at one of our adoption events on Saturdays at PetSmart in Garner (White Oak Shopping Center). \n\nWe will contact you as soon as possible once we receive your application.\n\nThanks for thinking adoption!",

She craves attention and loves a good couch to relax on all day. She would be a great netflix and chill kinda gal! You would need to watch your snacks though... we seen she was putting on some extra unnecessary weight while in rescue so we had to start watching her food intake.We're not sure what she had been through before entering rescue but she was really scared and wasn't sure when the other shoe was going to drop. She has definitely broken out of her shell and lets the other dogs know she's the boss!! She is crate trained and knows when it's time to go in especially, when its feeding time. She is definitely a foodie!!",

We will make every attempt to process all applications within 3 business days of receipt.\n\n// //\n\nMeet Elvis! This sweet little man is looking for someone to \"Love me Tender\". Elvis is a 12 year old, five pound Chihuahua that is deaf and has visual impairments- so if you snore or have a bad hair day, Elvis won't mind a bit! He learns his way around his new surroundings and is nervous at first but gets more comfortable over time. Elvis loves the sunshine! Although he is still getting used to walking on a leash, Elvis loves to cruise around and bask in the sun on the patio at his foster home and explore on the grass. Elvis is working on his house training. This \"Hunk of Burning Love\" is a good eater, much like the King himself, and often comes into the kitchen to see if it's meal time. Elvis sleeps well and doesn't seem to mind dogs or cats. Little Elvis is easy going and although he will need a little extra support to help him adjust we are sure that you \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" with him. Elvis is neutered, microchipped and current on his vaccines. His adoption fee is $200.\n\nAll Second Chance Dog Rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, are up to date on vaccines and have microchips prior to adoption.\n\nAdoption fees vary depending on age of dog. Fees help Second Chance Dog Rescue cover spay/neuter costs,\n\nvaccinations, medical treatments,\n\nfood and supplies. Please go to\n\nwww.secondchancedogrescue.org\n\nand complete an application today!\n\nAll dogs live in private foster homes until they are adopted.",

She was not walking well when she was impounded in Los Angeles but those days are over and she is getting around well now.  Some slippery surfaces set her back but she takes everything in stride and holds her own.  So glad we took got her to safety.  Dottie is the perfect example of a MCR dog.  She would not have been adopted, would have died in a dog pound.  And what a shame.  Dottie has made major strides, walking,  and now even her fur looks beautiful now.  She had some skin issues now healed and she has become quite the little lady with confidence she never showed and a tail wag now and then and part of the gang.  With the right person Dottie should blossom, loved to the very end no matter the time she has. What a joy it will be to know her.",

She stays to herself and remains a shy dog who would rather not be the center of attention. This tiny gal of only 5years old came to us as an owner surrender turned into an LA dog pound. Why? We are guessing it is because she had some mammary masses and wasnt spayed and needed her teeth cleaned so basically it might have been because her owner could not afford what care was needed or saw seizures etc. A quiet home would be best. A loving home is a must. She is a good dog who listens well and has a long life ahead. And her photos do not do her justice. She is under 6 pounds so a home without children would be best as she is shy.  She also should only be with dogs who are non aggressive because she can sometimes guard food.",

Lilly is often reactive to new people and animals and will bark on first meeting. When meeting Lilly, it is best to be quiet and just walk with her.  Eventually she will get curious and sniff you.  She does well on hikes and loves toys. She will entertain herself with her toys. She has no signs of resource guarding. She likes to play in the yard with other dogs and we think she would do well as a second dog with a nice, confident dog. Lilly is very smart and in tune with her person. We think she could be a terrific student at agility training. Lilly needs an experienced dog owner who will give consistency to her routine so she can enjoy home life. We recommend an adult-only home for Lilly and no apartment/condo living and no cats. If you are willing to get to know this girl who is so deserving of a second chance in life, please email dogs@daws.org to discuss further. Some dogs need a little more work to settle into their forever home and Lilly is one of those dogs. She will be a great companion to someone willing to put the time in to win her heart.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR PUPPY ADOPTION:\n1) PUPPIES WILL ONLY BE PLACED IN HOMES WITH YOUTHFUL, PLAYFUL, DOGS. This helps integrate the dog into your household easier by giving the pup a mentor.\n2) In addition to the youthful playful dog, someone MUST also be home at least part of the day. Please do not apply for a puppy if you are gone 8-10 hours a day. It is not a good situation for you or the puppy.\n3) You must have plans in place to socialize your puppy properly.\n4) Our puppies are not livestock dogs. They must be family pets that are allowed inside the home.\n\nPlease watch this short video which demonstrates how puppies learn polite behavior from their adult dog mentors. https://youtu.be/R6N8STRl2aI\n\nMeet Indiana! He's a bouncy flouncy goofball! Born around April 2020, he is innately a very happy, playful boy. He weighs around 55 pounds, and his coat is becoming longer and thicker.\n\nIndy, or Happy as we also call him, recently had a DNA test that gave a lot of insight into his active silly personality. He is 12% Great Pyrenees, with 38% Staffordshire Terrier, 13% Australian Cattle Dog, and 18% Chow. The test was able to detect a total of 11 breeds in this little guy!\n\nAnother test he had, and passed with flying colors in his foster home, is the \"good dog\" test!\n\nIndiana is a sweet natured, extremely loving, loyal pup. He loves attention and cuddles. His favorite place to spend the night is up in bed snuggled with his people.\n\nThis pup has never met a stranger! He can be a little overwhelming in his excitement to meet new people, but he settles quickly into being a solid lovebug.\n\nIndy gets along wonderfully with all the other dogs he's met during his foster stay. He must have a big, playful dog buddy in his forever home. He had a young Weimaraner visit for a week and befriended him instantly. They played non-stop! He is much more active than his 12% Pyr heritage!\n\nHe loves playing in water! He enjoys playing in the pool as well as out in the rain.\n\nHe does well on walks, is crate trained, housebroken, gentle receiving treats, and knows basic commands.\n\nIndiana would love to live in an active home where children play with him and the family keeps him engaged in their lives.\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

He is the happiest, and most easy going dog in my house right now. He has so much love to give and is really taking to being an indoor dog now. He loves to be near his people and is starting to get the hang of snuggling, which he has started asking for pets and affection in the cutest ways! He was heartworm positive, but has begun his treatment and is so far tolerating everything extremely well. He has a couple more months to go in his protocol but let me tell you he is worth the wait! \n\nWhat RayRay's foster mom has to say about him:RayRay is such an amazing guy! He was previously an outdoor-only dog who spent all his time chained up. He is initially a little shy but with a few treats and time to get his bearings he quickly warms up! He loves to play with squeaky toys and loves rolling around the grass and exploring outside. He especially loves to be near his people, and is now hooked on pets and ear massages, but he is also completely content to just be at your feet while working. His heart is so big, and he's hoping there might be a little room in yours for him too!\n\nHe is not officially potty trained, but so far we have had almost no accidents. He loves having a schedule and is very good at going to the bathroom outside when let out.\n\nHe is not very comfortable walking on a leash, which we are working on, but he will likely do best in a home with access to a yard.\n\nHe is overall healthy, though he did have some dental disease. RayRay will be getting neutered and a dental cleaning on 8/11/20!\n\nHe currently lives with 2 other dogs and 2 cats and is very easy going.\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

Lilly is very sweet and affectionate.\nAll of Lilly\u2019s medical expenses will be paid for by BAHS. This includes pre/post-surgical care and medications. We will also help with getting Lilly to and from appointments if necessary. Lilly\u2019s activities will be restricted, so a low-key environment where she is not alone during the day is ideal. She is okay with kids but is selective about other dogs and may do well with a canine sibling. We will have dates for surgery once we find a foster. \nIf you are interested in becoming Lilly\u2019s medical foster, please email bahshelter@yahoo.com. If there are other dogs in your home, we require a meet and greet, which you can schedule via email at bahshelter@yahoo.com.\n\nLilly is as sweet as she is pretty! Her favorite past times are running, exploring, and cuddling. She is learning how to walk properly on a leash and will sit pretty for a treat. Lilly is selective about other dogs and may do well with a canine sibling but should be in a cat-free house. This gorgeous girl is a terrier mix and weighs 50 pounds. Her birthday is June 2, 2019.\nLilly is spayed, microchipped, and current on all vaccinations, and she takes preventative flea/tick/heartworm medicine.\nAs with all our dogs, Lilly must be an indoor dog.\nIf you are interested in adopting Lilly, please email bahshelter@yahoo.com.

House broken and crate trained. She would be an ideal dog for a first time dog parent for sure! Interested in adopting?

As you can see, I love to be held. And no worries about me \u2014 I am totally housebroken.\n\nAs some older dogs do... I can have a small leakage problem with my bladder BUT, they found one little Proin pill a day and I am fine!\n\nI should be good with any family, especially low-key. Other dogs are fine. We can just relax and hang out or go for walks together. Like I said \u2026 I\u2019m an easygoing lady.\n\nCome see me at \n\nhttp://www.jackrusselladoptions.org/",

My life didn\u2019t start off too great as I appear to have been abused. I am on the mend and getting better each day, however, I do have some medical needs. I do walk with a little limp, sometimes I walk on my tippy toes, and sometimes I hop like a bunny. But that doesn\u2019t slow me down. My foster mom calls me bun bun. The skin on my hind leg has been slow to mend. We\u2019ve had some great progress, and some setbacks along the way. We are currently trying different techniques to help mend my injuries from my prior life. I may require some vet check ups, to continue to help my injuries heal, as well as keep my allergies at bay. I'm okay with other dogs, but do best with calm, older dogs who aren't so 'in your face', and respectful of space. I could also live with no other dogs and be happy with it. I am a sweet girl who loves to cuddle, and I absolutely adore attention. I am potty trained and very food motivated. I'm not a fan of crates, but I haven't been destructive or shown any signs of having anxiety when my foster mom leaves the house. \n\nI love going on walks, and roaming around in the backyard, but I don\u2019t like being left alone outside too long... maybe just 10 minutes for a quick potty break, but I would love to be outside with you for longer if we are just hanging out in the yard. I am a happy girl and I love being around my people. I deserve a loving family who knows how to treat me right and make me a part of their family. I have been around men and women and have done great. I have not been around any children. Oh, and whenever I see a cat on our walks, I have the urge to chase it. What dog doesn\u2019t, right? I have medium energy, but I can just be a couch potato, too. I love taking car rides, and I love hanging out in the car. I will snuggle with you all day if you\u2019ll let me. Will you be a part of my forever?\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

Bonnie is very clean and likely housetrained.  Adoption fees for Bonnie are waived to the right family who will properly take care of her and give her lots of love.  Bonnie did have a tumor removed from her leg, which turned out to be a low grade cancer, but hopefully it won't come back..  Please call or apply at hartshelter.org because we are operating by appointment only with an approved application on file.  Hoopeston Animal Rescue Team is located in Hoopeston Illinois and we can be reached at 217.283.0779.  Thank you.",

            "description": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m Roxy\u2026I\u2019m all white pit mix with cute little black dots on my belly\u2026.I weigh about 55 lbs I\u2019m in excellent shape, I\u2019m very energetic and in great health!\nI\u2019m very, very soft and are you aware polka dots are making a comeback?!  I\u2019m 8 years young, and all of that time except since mid-January of 2020 I had a family.  I lived with a cat and two small human siblings.  My world changed drastically on that day in January, and to tell you the truth I can\u2019t really  remember what happened\u2026.all I know is that the next day I no longer had a home, I was left in a loud very confusing place.  Up until that day I thought they loved me, I learned all the tricks and always performed perfectly on cue, I can sit, sit pretty which means sitting only on my hind legs and reaching for you with my front arms, I know dance,  down, no, come, stay, belly \u2026.everyone says I am a smart girl!!   I still know my housetraining and I keep an exceptionally clean kennel here.  I love to play ball I\u2019m a first class fetch player!!  The nice lady who came to interview me thought I could do well with agility\u2026always good to keep both your mind and body in shape you know!!  I take treats super gently and I promise to show you my love every day in so many little ways\u2026gosh how I love my humans!\n\nI do like to be the only girl in the house, but I used to get along fine with male dogs and small dogs and I lived with a furry feline.  The shelter thinks a home without felines might be best, since I am very curious about them.  Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to be myself here, there are so many animals it\u2019s loud, I\u2019m just  not used to it all\u2026.I had my family since I was just a wee pup it\u2019s all I knew and I try to put on a happy face and make the most of my time here, but truth be told I long to have a family to call my own again.   I hope and pray, paws crossed that someone will read this and give me a second chance at a loving home\u2026.please come for me soon\u2026please!   Roxy\n",

            "description": "Shuka (formerly Fairuza) is a very active and playful girl. She was found as a stray so needs basic obedience and socialization to teach her boundaries and how to play nice with others. Shuka would do best as an only dog in the home. Her high energy level dictates she live in a household with no children under 15 years old. She is fascinated by cats to the point of chasing and should live in a home free of small furry critters. Sounds can be very upsetting so she needs a quiet home with room to run and play. Shuka needs a strong leader who has the patience, calmness and love to help her gain self-control and focus on learning good behaviors. She is very smart and a problem solver, so she needs an adopter at least as smart as she is.\n\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

Java is well behaved in a home. He is housetrained, not destructive at all and is all about snoozing in the sun. He loves to go for early morning walks and rides great in the car.\nLike all our dogs Java is neutered,fully vaccinated and had blood work checked. He had entropion surgery, that is a surgery to correct a Sharpei problem where the eye lid is folded inward and causes irritation on the eye. It is well heeled now and Java's eyes are perfect. Java would do best as an only dog or with a mellow little dog. \nJava's adoption fee is $350.

            "description": "Date of birth:  6/27/2019\n\n1/7/2021:  Jack is an adorable B&W American Staffordshire Terrier mix!  He\u2019s a year old and currently weighs 48 lbs, but he\u2019s thin and needs to put on some weight.\n\n\u2022 Jack is very affectionate!  He can be timid at first when meeting new people.  It may take him a little while to settle into his new home and feel comfortable, so he\u2019ll need his person or family to be patient with him.   He\u2019s very food motivated, so treats will definitely help him trust more quickly!\n\n\u2022 He\u2019d do best with a pet parent who has dog experience.  We think he\u2019d be fine with older kids who are 10 years or older, with dog savvy parents.\n\n\u2022 We\u2019d like to place Jack in a home with a fenced yard.  He is playful and energetic.\n\n\u2022 Jack is a bit dog choosy, but has made doggie friends here and plays nicely with his friends.  If you have a dog we\u2019d ask you to bring your dog to meet Jack to see if they could be buddies. \n\n\u2022\u00a0He does need a home without cats.\n\n\u2022 Jack\u2019s a fast learner and knows Sit and Shake. He loves rope toys and doesn\u2019t shred them to bits.  \n\n\u2022 He was house trained in his former home, but may have accidents while adjusting to a new home. We were told that he needs to go outside to poop immediately after eating. \n\n\u2022 He\u2019s been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms.  Jack had parvo virus when we took him in.  He\u2019s fully recovered and healthy now, and ready for a new home! \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

I got a bad deal when my people left me for dead in a cold cruel place. No explanation but I suspect it's because I had this bump on my leg.\n\nFortunately some awesome volunteers found me and got me the surgery I needed. I feel sooo much better now. I spend my days hanging in the sunshine, getting belly rubs, and playing with my foster siblings.\n\nAll I want is a loving place to live out my life. Someone who will come home to me, take me to walks, brings me cookies, and tell me I'm a good girl.\n\nif that's you come see me!\n\nRetrieveafriend.Org/adopt",

Denver loves to play. In fact, it seems that he would never stop playing if that was an option. Tough toys are a must--those soft, squishy toys don't have a chance with this boy.\n\nDenver is smart and super motivated by treats. He will sit, shake, lay down and wait for you if you have the goods. Ok, so he is still working on \"drop it,\" but hey, he's still young. He loves to get outdoors, so he makes sure to behave on a leash. Feel like going further than the neighborhood? Great! Denver loves car rides too. When this pup is all tuckered out, he likes to be up on furniture because he wants to cuddle up with his people all the time.\n\nDenver is still young, so he needs an active family. He is a pup that will not do well with a doggy door, as he will have a desire to climb the fence to go find you. So he'll need to be in a home without that option.\n\nDenver would do best with another dog to play with, so he doesn't have a lot of idle time. If you have the time to give this pup your home and your heart, meet Denver today!\n\nNOTE: Unfortunately, he is very wary with strangers, so he will need a calmer home, with just his owners in residence, and no strangers coming and going into the home.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

He is super playful and loves long walks around the neighborhood, super social with everyone he meets! He doesn't like to be pet or held too much, but once he gets comfortable with you he loves to hang out and will give the most adorable little kisses and nibbles. \nHe needs an experienced and patient adopter who can work with him on learning to trust people and help him with some bad habits like resource guarding and some barking. He has anxiety and may need to be on medication, we are still working through that. He is also scared of loud noises and will bark when he hears unexplained and very loud noises, like vaccuums, blenders, and people walking in and out of an apartment. He would do best in a larger apartment or a house where he is not able to hear every noise! He is 4 years old and 11 pounds.\n\nDo you have room in your heart and home for little Macho?

            "description": "Friends to the Forlorn\nAdopt-a-BullBreed: Pit Bull Terrier Gender: Male Estimated Date of Birth: April 26, 2019 Size: 45 lbs Location: Marietta, GA\nRESCUING AUGIE\nA good friend of ours was alerted to a bad situation in Rockmart regarding 3 puppies living outside with their mother on a chain. The neighbors were caring for the pups, but the condition of the pups was declining and being outside in the blazing Georgia heat at such a young age was not helping. Augie wasn't using his back legs and his back foot was very badly injured.\nABOUT AUGIE\nAugie presented as a 'swimmer' pup at first, but as the weeks passed, our vet determined he had neurological issues in his hind legs and severe hip dysplasia. Additionally, at 7 weeks of age, prior to being rescued, he had a severe injury to his right, hind paw. It took several weeks to heal and caused a deformity in that paw. On September 26, 2019, Augie had an FHO surgery to correct the hip dysplasia on his left, hind leg. His front legs have always been very strong and he hasn't had any trouble getting around.\nSince September 2019, Augie received regular electro-acupuncture, hind leg strength training, and physical therapy. In the house, he walks on his own and he can go up and down stairs. During walks in the neighborhood or parks, Augie uses his 'mini wheels' (walker). It is so funny to watch him; he spins, runs, and has fun just like every other dog - he LOVES his wheels! Compact-sized, Augie in his little walker is a cuteness overload and he makes people smile.\nEven though Augie had to go through all the pain and physical limitations, he is just the happiest guy you could imagine. He has a zest for life and he wakes up smiling. He doesn't think that anything is wrong with his legs and he knows how to have fun.\nAugie loves to play with dogs and he also loves to snuggle on the couch. He feels comfortable in his crate and he is extremely food driven. Augie is also housetrained and holds his business just like every other healthy dog. If you want a dog that inspires you to make the best out of life, Augie is your guy!\nAugie would likely do best in a home with another playful dog. It is also preferred that the home has very few stairs so that he is not restricted once he gets older, otherwise his human would have to be committed to assisting his back end during the stair climb. When adopted, Augie's 'mini wheels' will go with him.\nSee Augie in action!: https://youtu.be/-jEMqEZP_9I\nPhoto Album of Augie: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2631879653536851&__tn__=-UC-y.g\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Hope is a beautiful 2 year old Pix mix that was brought in as a stray. We don't know much about Hope's past, but what we do know is that she has the sweetest eyes about her. She is very dog selective, some dogs make her a little uncomfortable so she would need a proper introdcution if there are other dogs in the home. She is beyond loving and would be with you 24/7 if you allowed it. She is very well mannered, she knows sit-wait, shake and go. She does have a small quirk, she is obsessed with squirrels!\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Hope is $150 and includes four sets of puppy shots, two dewormings (done prior to adoption) her spay, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037. You may also send a message to our Amazing Grace Bully Rescue Page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or send an email directly to amazinggracebullyrescue@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer: We are located in the Pensacola, Florida area and will consider local applicants first, especially with puppies since we use a vet in the local area.",

He is currently living with a female dog (Holly, also available for adoption) who is his BFF. Ben can be jumpy when he gets excited so he would do best in a home with older kids. Ben is a bit cautious with new people but warms up. No cats for Ben.\n\nPlease email us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com to find out if Ben is the right one for you! (Local adoptions preferred - Philadelphia and tri-state area [South Jersey and northern Delaware] only.)\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US!\nWe are NOT a shelter: All of our dogs live in private homes with foster families. Come and meet the Almost Home dogs and their fosters at our Meet & Greet events, where you can learn more about our wonderful dogs from the people who live with them, find out which dogs are on their way and when they'll arrive, and fill out an application to adopt or foster.\n\nWe cannot adopt to homes where electric-shock fencing systems or training collars are used. For more information on the dangers of electric-shock collars, please visit banshockcollars.ca/studies.php and http://www.hollysden.com/say_no_to_shock.htm (scroll down and click on the \"Invisible Fencing Systems\" link).\n\nWe do not have an online adoption application; to request an application, e-mail us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com. To speed e-mail processing time, be sure to note the name of the dog you are inquiring about in the Subject line. For Meet & Greet times and locations, visit our home page, where you also will find information on our adoption process and fees.\n\nFOSTER FAMILIES ARE LIFESAVERS!! Can you open your heart and home for a few weeks to homeless shelter dog? Remember, by fostering a dog, you save TWO lives - that of your foster dog, and that of the dog who takes his place in the shelter! Come to a Meet & Greet and find out if fostering is for you - there's no reward quite like the feeling that you've saved a life ... or two!",

She's a super sweet, fun-loving, snuggly girl! Lizzy's perfect day is chewing on a Kong, going for a walk and snuggling up after a long day.  Lizzy is one smart girl and passed her basic training class with a gold star!  As outgoing as this fun girl is, she can be a bit shy meeting new people and likes to get to know people at her own pace.  She's already house-trained and crate-trained and ready to meet the family she will lavish with all the love and joy she has to give.\n\nForever home:  Due to her energy level and boundless big puppy excitement, Lizzy would do best in an adult household or with older, active children.  She would do best in a home without other animals. She loves chewing on bully sticks and Kongs \u2013 peanut butter is her favorite!  Lizzy would do best with a patient and involved family who will continue her training and socialization.  She'd love a fenced yard to zoom around in and get her sniffs on.  No invisible fences please.\n\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog, please complete the Adoption Application on our website, www.waggintailsdogrescue.org>Adopt>Adoption Application.\n \nADOPTION INFO:\n \nWe do not have a facility; all of our dogs are fostered in private homes.   We generally have two adoption events per month.  To meet a dog in person, please see our event calendar on our website for the date and time of the next adoption event. Arrangements can be made to meet a dog outside of Saturday adoption events after an application is submitted and approved.\n\nOur adoption process includes an application and in-home meet-n-greet with the dog.\n   \n-Adult Dog Adoption Fee - $225\n-Small Breed Adoption Fee - $275\n-Senior Dog Adoption Fee - $125\n-Pup Adoption Fee - $250 plus $50 spay/neuter deposit refunded upon proof of surgery by 6 mos.\n \nThank you for supporting dog rescue and your interest in a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Who could resist this happy face?!  This special lady is Star.  She arrived in Wisconsin a couple weeks ago after a long trip from our friends at Pet Tribe in Texas. She is 7 years old, 63 pounds and her breed is a best guess. This poor girl was chained up in a back yard with the chain also wrapped around her paw. She started chewing her paw to get loose and a concerned neighbor convinced the owner to surrender her to a rescue.  Thankfully they did!\n\nAlthough she had a rough start, Star is still a loving dog and will make an amazing companion. She is said to love every human she meets! Star is super playful, loyal, smart, a good listener, and enjoys a good snuggle session.  She is selective about dogs so may require multiple meets with a dog companion and would need to be closely monitored in the home.  Star is a happy-go-lucky gal with lots of great personality quirks and is very playful but can get possessive over special treats/toys and has some food aggression issues but her foster mom has been working very hard to help her with this!  Because of this, we would recommend her go to a home with older children that would be able to understand those boundaries. She does not like her crate but has been doing well in the tall kennel run at her foster home.\n\nIt is not hard to fall in love with Star once you meet her, so we hope her perfect family is out there for her.  She has come such a long way and can\u2019t wait to have a home of her own ???\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Star, please fill out an application at http://misfitmuttsdogrescue.com/adoption/\n\nIf you are already an approved applicant and would like to meet Star or have any questions, please email our adoptions team at misfitmuttsdogrescue@gmail.com.",

            "description": "HOLD ON TO YOUR HATS!!!!!!  Yesiree, hold on tight cause you just are not going to believe this wonderful little twelve pound, Sheltie/Chihuahua mix!! What a fantastic fella we have here!!!   Is he ever so gorgeous! He's definitely a head turner.  But wait, there's more!  He's not only a looker, he is the \"perfect pet!\"  He is completely housebroken and totally trustworthy to be left home alone. A bit shy at first, but give him a minute and is your BFF!  He's such a happy, fun, playful, lovable, hugable little buckaroo. He folks, he is the total package, the bee's knees, the top 'o the ritz, the real deal, yesiree, he has got it all!  He's very easy going, sweet as sugar, and more lovable than you can imagine. His birthday is March 19, 2019, he's just a youngster with lots 'n lots of gooood years ahead of him. As soon as you sit down in your chair, or on the couch, he is right there at your feet, asking \"Can I come up? Huh, huh? Can I, can I? Plleeeez!!\"  He's a quite a sports buff too.  Whoa Nellie, he has been SOOOOO happy college football season is just around the corner.  Unfortunately, he is now sooo disappointed because with Covid 19, there hasn't been much of a college football season. He is sooo distraught, so sad, really sooo upset!! Does not look like there will be much of a college basketball season either. Normally folks, he'll plum run over you to get to that TV when there's a college football or basketball game on.  Whew, this little buckaroo means business!  Ha ha ha!!  He would normally be right by your side, the whole time the game is on, pulling for his favorite team!  When the TV is turned off and it is time to turn in for the night, don't be a bit surprised to find him sitting there on the bed looking at you as if to say, \"what took you so long??\" He's ready to snuggle in right next to you !!!  You can rest assured you will NEVER in your life find a more devoted companion than this little sugar baby.   He WILL be your bestest bud forever and ever!!  He'll follow you wherever you go and will never be more than one step behind you! He also gets along well with other doggies and kitty kats! You know what is sad though??  This little peach did have a home once.  Due to unfortunate circumstances, his owner was unable to keep him any longer and that  meant he was OUT the door!  Right now he has no idea what's going on!  Poor little baby!  But he will be absolutely fine because his foster mom and dad are giving him ALL the love, hugs and kisses he can stand.  They are totally thrilled with him and they have very quickly determined he is one fabulous little chap!!  They are sooo happy to have him. We do have a couple of requirements for Max's new home. He loooves his canine cronies, he loooves to play. We have promised Max we will make sure the home he gets WILL have another dog, roughly his size and age to play with! NO EXCEPTIONS!!  We have also promised Max his new home will have a very safe, secure fenced yard so he and his new BFF will have lots of room to run around and play, play, play! NO EXCEPTIONS!! Please, please, please, DO NOT leave a message if you do not meet his requirements, which are, a fenced in yard, a playmate roughly his size and roughly his age! NO, NO, NO EXCEPTIONS! We have also promised Max that his new home will be his home for the rest of his life!!  Just so you know, we DO keep our promises.  He loves to go on walks and loves car rides!  You will NEVER find a more wonderful, handsome, sweeter pet than this fine, exceptional little gent!!  For you interested folks out there, please call 352-438-8283.  Hurry, hurry---he's ready and waiting to go home with you!!!  He won't be available for long, he's just waaaay too sensational!!  Adoption donation $350.00.",

I like to hangout in the sun and I do well with other large dogsjust ask my four legged foster sister! I can be a stubborn boy, so I'll do best in a home that will give me boundaries and structure, and one without children. I can't wait to be someone's forever buddy!

She\u2019s living in a wonderful foster home but really needs a permanent home and family so she can finally start the next chapter of her life. She\u2019s very sweet and will wiggle over to greet you! Kendra can be a bit fearful of men if approached suddenly when in her little sleeping nook but is otherwise great with the men she\u2019s met. We aren\u2019t sure how she is with kids so for now think a more quiet adult home may be best. Kendra has played with other dogs her size and has done well, just plays a bit exuberantly at times so needs a doggy friend who can handle her play style.\n \nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more and/or setting up a meet and greet, please email Lisa@spca914.org.\n\nDue to Covid-19 the SPCA is allowing adoptions by appointment only. If you\u2019d like to discuss an animal and/or set up a meet and greet please email shelter@spca914.org with your competed application and a copy of your driver\u2019s license or a government issued ID. Please allow up to 72 hours for a response! Thank you for your understanding! \n\nAdults dogs over 1 year of age: $225-$375\nAll Puppies: $375\nSeniors and Lonely Hearts Club members: $85\n\nPlease visit: http://www.spca914.org/adoptanimal.htm to read our Adoption Policy and Procedures in full.\n\nFeel free to e-mail shelter@spca914.org or call (914) 941-2896 ext. 11 with any questions or for more details on the dog(s) in which you are interested.\n\nNYS Registration # RR056",

The application to adopt can be found at www.camorescue.com.\n\nAdoption Fee:  $300 plus 8.25% sales tax\n\n(Baby MUST go to a home with another dog.  Please do not apply if you do not currently have one - thank you.)\n\n This little girl is in need of a quiet home with kind, loving, patient, humans and a friendly dog to help her learn to be a dog again. She is very sweet, but VERY timid - we cannot stress this enough, she is VERY timid,  She does come around pretty quickly if you have the patience to help her - be aware that this could take several weeks or even months. Please do not apply for her if you do not have the time and patience to work with her. \n\nShe is happy in her foster home because she has doggie friends and a kind foster mom who has given her the time and space needed to learn that she is safe and has nothing to worry about. Baby, was rescued from a hoarding situation along with 14 other small dogs.  She\u2019s only about 4 years old and deserves to spend the rest of her life in a loving home knowing she\u2019s loved and wanted. She weighs a whopping 22 lbs. is spayed, up to date on shots, hw negative and microchipped.  Please contact us if you think you can help her become the happy little dog she deserves to be. \n\nAdoption fees are variable. Up to date vaccines, microchip, spay/neuter are included in the fee.\n\nOnce your application has been approved, we will put you in touch with the foster to set up a  meet and greet. We are a foster based RESCUE, not a shelter. All of our dogs are in individual foster homes. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We select the best applicant for each dog, based on the dog's needs. \nFor the safety of our small breed dogs and based on our past experiences, we will not place our dogs in homes with large breed dogs.    \n\nCAMO rescue is a 501c3 whose primary focus is rescuing small dogs from the euthanasia list from high kill TX shelters.   \nEIN # is 46-5486022\nWe rescue 800+ animals a year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/camorescue\n\nOur donation link is http://www.paypalme/camorescue \n\nWe are strictly volunteer based, no salaries are paid and 100% of donations go towards rescuing dogs.",

            "description": "In Memory of Papa Ouderkirk\n\n'I have always had a huge heart for all animals, but especially cats. We even adopted two cats from Joyful Rescues: Leia and Lucy. Lucy is actually one of the cats that came from a transport, and when I saw how small and weak, she was, as well how she always scarfed down every meal as if it would be her last, I felt terrible for her. I would like to name this transport \"The Papa Ouderkirk Memorial Transport\" in memory of my grandfather, who passed away in 2019 due to lung cancer he was a lover of cats as well'. - Christianna Reynolds\n\nFreebie was born around August 04, 2019 and weighs about 20 pounds. It seems Freebie came from a puppy mill or backyard breeding situation. She ADORES other dogs and is happy and playful with them. Freebie wants to love us humans and will walk up to us but runs in fear when we try to touch her. Freebie has never been aggressive to human touch just extremely fearful. Freebie must have a secure fenced in yard and another playful well socialized dog in her next home. It is going to take some work and patience to show Freebie that humans are wonderful but the outcome will be well worth it for you and for Freebie . Please do some reading on working with mill dogs before applying to adopt Freebie. Update: Still no human has touched this girl, but she will come within a few feet of the human she sees the most. When she gets near I smile, wave, and say her name and she wags her tail, but will run immediately if I move toward her. I'll keep working on it. She does use the dog door freely and does come into the TV room with the other dogs and two humans in the evening, but she looks around, plays with another dog and then she is off doing more dog things. Freebie does shed.\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $450.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

            "description": "**My adoption fee is one half off! Adoption fee: $200**. Johnny is an amazing boy! He is very social, happy, affectionate and loving. He will greet you with a big smile and non-stop tail wagging. Such a sweet boy, he loves playing with other medium to large dogs - he's fine around small dogs but might be a tad too physical for some. Johnny can be wary of strangers entering the home once he's bonded with his person / people and can't be left alone in a yard since he can jump a fence if he wants to. He's athletic and wants to be where the action is! Otherwise, he is great being crated when being left alone. Johnny would love to go to an active and predictable home without too many unexpected visitors. He will do best in a no child household just because he is active, a little mouthy, and quite wiggly - but with dog savvy parents he should do well - but best case scenario is active fun-loving folks with the time to go out and play with their dog every day! This is a dog to lounge with, wrestle with - love on, and go have plenty of all kinds of adventures with. **My adoption fee is one half off! Adoption fee: $200.**\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

Actually, Id much rather be hanging out and loving my best friends then playing games with them. Im a big fan of meeting new people, and I like meeting new dogs, too. Im good with big and small dogs, but I prefer more gentle play, as I mentioned before. And, for extra bonus points, I dont really like to bark that much. Im just a sweet, loving, and quiet girl, looking for a loving home to adopt me!",

My (3) brothers and I were found in a ditch as puppies; the kind people at ARFhouse took us in and gave us a place to live while we look for our forever homes! I've been at the sanctuary for almost 2 years now and I am very anxious for a family of my own. I am 2.5 years old, 65 lbs. and they say I am some sort of Beagle/Hound mix. Heck, I could be a lot of things! \n\nI am super sweet but also very shy. I am unsure of myself sometimes and new places scare me. I need some training, basic manners and leash training (nothing crazy!). I am good with other dogs and I love to run and play! I will need a fenced yard for exercise and play time and I would love a home with a four-legged companion. It might take me a little bit to adjust to my new home as I've been at the rescue for almost 2 years, but I promise once I'm used to being part of a family, I will make a wonderful family member! \n\nThe fee to adopt Berto is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, de-worming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Berto, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Berto is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Berto, please fill out an application on our website. If approved, we will contact you within 48 hours to set up a time to meet Berto.",

            "description": "Dakota is a 5 year old neutered male black & brown Australian Shepherd mix. He was surrendered by his previous family due to his extreme separation anxiety. He cannot be left unsupervised in a regular crate, as he will injure himself trying to escape. Dakota needs a home that will provide him with A LOT of exercise to help decrease his anxiety. He walks well on a leash and would love a family that would take him running or hiking frequently. He also does well at doggy daycare. Dakota is sometimes scared of men at first, but he will get used to them with time. Dakota seems to do well with most other dogs and has not been tested with cats. If you're interested in adopting Dakota, please fill out an application via our website scsheltierescue.com. His adoption donation of $200 includes neuter, all vaccinations and microchip. His adoptive family will also need to purchase an escape-proof crate prior to adoption. These are expensive and take up a lot of space in the home, so please research Impact crates or similar brands before applying to adopt. FEBRUARY 2021",

He is a bouncy and loving young boxer who likes to be with his people. He is very intelligent and a good listener, and takes treats gently. He's house trained, crate trained, and walks well on a leash. He's just looking for a forever home where he can run and play, and of course get lots of pets and snuggles. Could it be with you?\n\n__________\n\n7/30/20: Bam is a super sweet and active young boy. He's looking for a home where he can get lots of exercise, and needs firm expectations and consistency.

            "description": "Star is a two (2) year old, 30 pound lab mix that was picked up by the shelter. While she was seemingly in good shape with a shiny coat and good weight, her eyes were both severely damaged and she was terrified not be able to see the barking dogs around her or know that she was safe from them. The whole time she was there she stayed curled in a ball pressed against the chain link. She dared not move from that spot because she didn't know what was around her. Once we got her to the vet, she did the same thing, curling up in a corner and not moving to even eat or go to the bathroom.\n\nWe were very lucky to find a foster and get her into a quiet home. Unfortunately, as soon as she was starting to relax and trust, it was time for her to go to the vet to be spayed. An exam on her eyes proved that she was blind and her eyes were likely causing her great pain, so they were both removed. She is clearly not comfortable with her blindness and we are not sure what happened but its obvious that she has not lived her life this way. Although scared, there is no aggression towards people or other dogs and we think that another friendly dog to mentor her would be great. For now, she spends her days on her bed, which is her safe space, and only moves to eat or potty, which she dutifully does on the \"pee pads\" in her room.\n\nStar has a challenging road ahead of her, but she is coming along well and with some patience and time, she has so much potential to have a full and happy life. If you would like to nurture this girl along this new road in her life, ALR will stand beside you and give you all the support needed. If you are interested in learning more and think that you can give her a home, please email us at info@atlantalabrescue.com",

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Buddy\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 2\n\nGender: Male\n\nDog's Size: Pocket Boxer (under 50lbs as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 49\n\nGood with small dogs?: No\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: No\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, older only\n\nAny medical issues?:\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n8/31/20: Hi My foster mom said it was time for me to introduce myself to everyone. My name is Buddy and I been part of the CBR family for a little while now. I am a very quirky boy as my foster mom likes to call it. It took me months for me to relax around her and the family. I get worried that someone is going to hurt me and it takes a while to let my guard down. They have a lot of patience with me and gave me my space to decompress. Now I love to lay with them and get lots of kisses and belly rubs.\n\nBefore coming into CBR I was underweight and scared of being left outside. Every time I would go on walks I would pull as hard as I could to go back inside. I still pull hard on the leash when I get scared. Foster mom is working on my leash manners but thinks that I will never be a dog that likes to be out in public. I love the backyard here. It seems like I can run forever and they keep throwing the ball for me. My fur sister keeps me very busy here and is always up for play time. I do get a little vocal when I play but I don't mean any harm and she knows it. So she gets vocal back.\n\nI don't like going into my crate but I do sleep there at night. They say it gives me time to relax. She has to throw a cookie in there before I go to bed. Then I shoot in there as fast as I can. She always shuts the door behind me but I don't mind because I am so focused on the treat. When I am out of the crate and not playing I like to watch out for my family to make sure they are safe. I will follow them around and make sure they know if someone is near the house.\n\nI know I am not the perfect dog from the start but if someone would take time and just stick it through. I am sure I could show them how great I really am like I have shown my foster family. Bye for now! Buddy\n\n________\n\n5/8/20: Hi everyone! My name is Buddy and I have been with CBR a few weeks now. Foster mom says I am settling in nicely. She has taken it really slow with me and I love that. You see before when I first came here I was really scared and didn't want to go out side at all. I would pull my hardest to get back inside. Each trip into the back yard I started to realize that nothing is going to hurt me and it is ok to play. Right now I don't do very well on walks because I am worried I would make it back to the house so I don't want to leave. At least in the back yard I know I cant get lost and will always be near the house.\n\nI love to chase the ball now and they laugh because I almost bring it back to them. You see I figure if they make me exercise they need to do a little also and come get the ball part way. I have been playing every minute I can with my fur sister. We are about the same age so she has energy that keeps up with me. We both take these mini naps and then its game on again. My foster parents say its like a obstacle course in the house. I like to relocate the toys all over the place so no matter where I go there is a toy to play with.\n\nMy foster parents are the greatest at letting me relax and come to them when I am ready. Its been a few weeks here and each day I feel more comfortable with them. They give me lots of treats and nice words all the time. Well last night I decided that it would be nice to lay near them on the couch. I got so many rubs on my head and belly. It was great!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

            "description": "Manny needs space and a fairly predictable environment. Dog savvy people, no kids. FOSTER REPORT: Manny is a very happy and sweet dog - not a mean bone in his body. He has a lot of energy and needs someone that can give him lots of exercise and give him structure. I have got a trainer that I am working with - happy to try and make some progress with him while he is staying with me. Someone who has experience with dogs is probably best. He is leash reactive and has some \"stranger danger\" with men. Cats are totally fine. He gets along really well with my dog, they cuddle and play so another dog would be great for him. He is a lovely dog, with the best smile and cutest bat ears. He will make a great companion. He needs someone that will have some patience with him and give him lots of love. \n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

            "description": "Looks like: Chihuahua\nFemale, 12 years old, 8 pounds\nDim Sum's name is almost as cute as her giant ears. This little lady has an adventurous heart. She is pretty fearless and loves to explore every nook and cranny she can find but is surprisingly not big on walking. She really enjoys being held, though. She has some arthritis, which makes it challenging to go up or down stairs or furniture. She needs help better understanding the leash and is likely the culprit of why walks are not her priority. She is polite with other dogs who mind her space. She will greet them but has no interest in mingling with them, she would rather be in your lap. She enjoys meeting new people. \n\nDim Sum is great in the home and being left alone, but will cry if crated. She has never lived with indoor cats but is friendly with the outdoor cats she met. She is also great meeting children. Dim Sum does have diminished hearing and vision. Her last dental had all of her teeth removed, but it does not slow her eating and a maze bowl is often used to help her eat appropriately. She has no off button when it comes to eating and she needs to be regulated by her future person. She is a mellow dog that is not interested in playing. \n\nDim Sum craves people. She is a wonderful friend and wants to lie down and be near her people. She occasionally whines if left behind in the car but is otherwise great for rides. A calm home with lots of snuggle time will be ideal for her. She does protect her food and water and we hope this diminishes and can be corrected. \n\nDim Sum came to us because her guardian has a family member with autism and the disruption to his normal schedule has been really challenging for him. They think Dim Sum would be safer and happier in a new home.",

He is crate trained, leash trained, and has some obedience training (knows sit, down, come, and place). He is housebroken and asks to go out. He is in good health (eating grain-free food for allergy), neutered, up to date on shots, and medical records are available. Bluegrass gets along with other dogs when introduced and older children; cats are unknown. He loves a kiddie pool, aims to please, and is treat motivated. He would do best in a home that has experience with his breed. There is no adoption fee for this special boy.\n\nIf you will welcome Bluegrass into a loving home as part of your family, please call Andrea between 9 AM and 7 PM at 520-307-9481.\n\nAugust 5, 2020\n\n\n\nThis is an Offsite listing, and there is no adoption fee for this pet.  It is listed solely as a courtesy to the owner/rescuer, and The Animal League of Green Valley assumes no responsibility for it. It is living with its owners (or in foster care) until a new home can be found. Adoption arrangements should be made directly between the owner and the adopter. Please contact telephone numbers or email address provided for more information on this pet.\n\nTo view additional animals and find out more about The Animal League of Green Valley, visit our website at www.talgv.org or call (520) 625-3170 between 10 am and 2 pm Monday though Sunday.",

            "description": "After months of waiting, Pansy is ready to start searching for her forever home!\n\nPansy is only around 2.5 years old and 45 pounds, aStaffordshire terrier/lab mix. She is a beautiful dawn coloring and the perfect size. \nPansy was found in the woods with two of her babies, who she\u2019d hidden in a rotting tree trunk. She was covered with demodex mange which made her appear years older. Her sweet, timid temperament wants NOTHING but to love you and shows more that she likely did not have a pleasant past. \n\nPansy will likely suffer from skin issues the rest of her life. She requires two baths a week currently with an anti-dandruff shampoo and is working one-on-one with a homeopathic vet to find a solution to best counteract her skin ailments. \nDespite it all and the pain she was likely in, Pansy NEVER stopped wagging her tail. She loves all people she meets and any dogs. She is extremely patient, tolerant, quiet and loving. She loves to give kisses and is very low energy and laid back. She has a sweet, beautiful personality that makes anyone who meets her fall in love. \n\nPansy has patiently awaited her adoption debut for months in her foster home as she recovered and got to a healthier version of herself. \nShe is up to date, microchipped and scheduled to be spayed. Pansy is heartworm positive and has been undergoing a slow treatment, which will be covered by the rescue. \n\nDespite her health conditions she hopes someone can look past everything and see her for the amazing companion she is. She needs a little more passion and care, but she will give it all in return in kisses and appreciation. She is so very thankful to be where she is today and shows it tirelessly. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nFor additional information see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

He is housebroken and asks to go out. He is in good health (except for some stiffness in knees and hips), neutered, up to date on shots, and medical records are available. Zeus loves people but not other animals. He loves a kiddie pool and is perfect in the car. He needs a very secure yard and would do best in a home that has experience with his breed. There is no adoption fee for this special boy.\n\nIf you will welcome Zeus into a loving home as part of your family, please call Andrea between 9 AM and 7 PM at 520-307-9481.\n\nAugust 5, 2020This is an Offsite listing, and there is no adoption fee for this pet.

            "description": "Pyrenees are like potato chips, you can never have just one. This Great Pyrenees bonded pair was rescued from a small Texas animal shelter. We don't know the circumstances as to how they ended up in the shelter but by their condition they must have been trying to survive for some time. Since being rescued, this bonded pair has gained weight, confidence and has learned valuable life skills for their forever home.\n\nPatti is an affectionate 3 year old, 75 lb. sweetheart. She enjoys meeting people, going on car rides and will happily keep you company running errands. This perfect companion will surely impress all your friends and those that meet her. Patti sits calmly for treats and melts at the prospect of belly rubs. She is okay with cats and walks well on leash She is the smaller of the two, but she is clearly the alpha dog.\n\nWitt is a handsome, friendly 3 year old, 90 lb. gentleman. He is dog and people friendly and is eager to please those he meets. He is an intelligent dog and catches on fast especially when a treat is the reward. He's not exactly happy with cats, but with really slow introductions he may be alright with them. Like his companion Patti, he also likes car rides and will quickly oblige a belly rub or two from you.\n\nBoth dogs are house trained, have had some basic training and some socialization. They are active young dogs with Pyr traits and will require a family without children and who is familiar with this breed. Both need daily walks and a secure fenced yard for exercise. They will need continued training with confident leaders that can provide firm but loving boundaries. With consistent, proper training this bonded pair has the potential of becoming loving, well-mannered, devoted family companions. They have a strong innate instinct to protect their family and home. If you have room in your heart for two wonderful dogs and can provide a loving forever home, please submit your application today.\n\nAll dogs and puppies require VISIBLE fencing\n\nAdoption Fee: $500 for the pair ((Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org. Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225).\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

He can't go anywhere without a toy. He is a little timid and shy at first but will warm up real quick with a little affection and a toy. Or a cheeseburger! YUM. Obedience training is highly recommended so he can be the best he can be. Bugsy is very energetic and playful and is very eager to please. The cutest quality about him besides his love for toys is when he finally relaxes you can hear him snort and snore. This goofy boy has won over everyone at the shelter...are you next? No cats for this boy, but he does a wonderful job as a mouser.\n\nHis adoption fee is $185.00 He is neutered, current on vaccinations, heartworm neg, has had his annual rabies vaccination, de-wormed and micro-chipped. If you are interested in adopting him please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday and the first Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm.

            "description": "$125 of adoption fee sponsored\n\nHi! I'm Avery. I'm a smart, sweet pittie girl who is almost 5 years old. I've been at Partner for Pets for almost 2 years, and I'm still waiting very patiently for my forever family. I don't know why I've been here for so long, and the staff and volunteers don't get it either. You see, I need to be an only pet. That's all I ask. I guess some people think its too much to ask, but I know the right family is out there who is going to want me for me and I'll be all they need! A little more about me, since I'm sure you're dying to know! I LOVE tennis balls. I could play fetch all. day. and never get tired! I love going on walks with my favorite volunteers. I keep a relatively clean kennel because I like to wait to do my business on walks. I could use a little bit of training, but I'm eager to please and willing to learn!\n\nBecause of my energy level, I would probably fit best in a home without small children. No dogs or cats either, please. I want alllll of the attention!\n\nMy adoption fee is $195, which covers the cost of my spay, microchip and up-to-date vaccines.\n\nWould you come meet me at the shelter? I promise to give you lots of kisses!!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm. We are also at Petco in Edwardsville Crossing on Sundays from 11:30-3:30 pm. The cats are only at Glen Carbon Petsmart.

What she lacks in leg length, she makes up for in her ability to jump - we swear this girl has springs attached to the bottom of her paws! Kaley is always looking on the bright side, bringing positivity and sunshine and smiles wherever she goes. Kaley is happy to see everyone - but she'll be even happier when she sees you on adoption day!\n\nKaley is a playful girl, but she can be a bit dominant at times. She needs a submissive, male partner if there is to be another dog in the home. No cats or small kids, please.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting and possibly adopting Kaley, please fill out an adoption application online through the link in our bio or at\nwww.partnersforpetsil.org/applications\n!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm.

            "description": "Came in w/ 3 pups04/28/18: Hi! My name is Miley, and I am about five (8) years old pit bull terrier mix. I have been at Partners for Pets for 6 years. I like the staff but I would love to have my own family. I am hesitant with new people, so I don't show my personality very well upon first meeting. I usually warm up faster with women; it takes a little longer with men. Children are not recommended. I really need a quiet home to feel safe. Once I get to know someone I am very affectionate, especially if someone will give me a belly rub. I am selective about which male dogs I will accept, and don't really get along with female dogs. I love to take long walks. Since I can sometimes be nervous about strangers out in public, my person must take care to avoid strangers coming up to me and trying to give me unsolicited attention. My adoption fee is $185. Would you like to meet me and see how I would fit into your family?\n\nHi I'm Miley.\nI do not have a tragic tale of unfortunate beginnings like some of my kennel mates do. I was just stray. Well not just a stray, I was a mom dog with my three precious babies, sitting in the pound. A lady from Partners came and saved my babies and took me too. Oh how grateful I was that my babies were going to live. I was even more grateful to hear that all three were adopted into loving homes. I was so hopefully that soon it would be my turn to find a forever home where I be loved and cherished too....but here I sit. You see, I have what you'd call \"stranger danger\" issues. New people can be kind of scary for me. I do much better with women and warm up faster to them, but men take me a little longer. I have gotten much better over the years, but the issue is sometimes still there. I do just great with the male care givers at the shelter that I've grown to love and trust. I love to roll over for tummy rubs and play with other male dogs. There is a volunteer that comes a few times a week to walk me and it took me 5 minutes to fall in love with her. I wish there was someone out there who would take a chance on me and be willing to help me work through my fear. I'm really a fun loving girl who loves play, snuggle and give lots of kisses. I am\nspayed, current on vaccinations, has her annual rabies vaccination, dewormed and micro-chipped. Her adoption fee is $185.00 IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, GO TO OUR HOME PAGE AT www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday 11am-3:30pm. We are also at Petco in Edwardsville Crossing every Sunday from 11:30-3:30 pm. The cats are only at Glen Carbon.

            "description": "Oh, Berlin. How do we even describe such a sweet, soulful pup? His eyes tell a myriad of stories with just one look, and all he asks is for you to listen and understand. He's a senior boy at almost 9 years old, but he's still got a spring in his step and a life worth living! Berlin loves long walks to the refrigerator for any and all snacks you want to share with him! He keeps a very clean kennel and loves to snuggle into the biggest, fluffiest blanket he can find. Berlin walks great on a leash, but can be a little strong when he's excited.\n\nNo cats for this boy please, but Berlin has done very well with submissive female dogs! Male dogs tend to not like him because he can get on a bit of a mounting spree, and he doesn't like to be corrected.\n\nHe's at the point in life where he wants to be respected and not pushed and pulled where he doesn't want to go. Because Berlin can get a little cranky when that happens, we recommend a home with no small children who may not know when he's had enough.\n\nBerlin's adoption fee is $195, and he is neutered, microchipped and is current on all vaccines!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm.

            "description": "\"I'm just a dog, standing in front of a family, asking them to love me.\" -Brewer, (if he could talk)\n\nBrew is almost a 13 year old Boxer mix who has been with Partners for Pets since 2015. He was originally pulled from St. Clair County Animal Control in 2015, and was adopted shortly after.\n\nWhen his adopter started going blind, he realized he could no longer care for Brewer, so he came back to us last summer. Brewer was so loved by his previous owner, and it shows through his sweet, tender disposition.\n\nFour years have come and gone as a Partners for Pets dog, and Brewer has gotten silver in the muzzle, but he still has a heart of gold he is ready to give to someone who is looking for a senior pet.\n\nIn the Game of Life, Brewer is so humble that he would probably choose to retire at Countryside Acres. Though we're pretty certain he wouldn't mind Millionaire Estates either..\n\nBrewer needs to be the only pet in a home. Just him, and his people. What more could you need?\n\nHe's ready to retire to his Countryside Acres. Do you think your home fits the bill? Apply to adopt Brewer today! We'll be more than happy to schedule a meet and greet with you and your future best friend.\n\nHis adoption fee is $195.00 He is neutered, current on vaccinations, heartworm neg, has his annual rabies vaccination, dewormed and micro-chipped. If you are interested in adopting please go to www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application. We hold adoptions at the O'Fallon IL Petsmart every Saturday and the Glen Carbon Petsmart the first Saturday of the month and every Sunday. Both days from 11:00 - 3:30.",

            "description": "04/28/18: Hi! My name is Tallie. I am a seven (10) year old pit bull terrier mix. I am hesitant with new people, so I don't show my personality very well upon first meeting. I don't really get along with other dogs or cats - I want my humans all to my self! I am not comfortable with being loved on by more than one person at a time, though, and don't appreciate having my hind end or belly touched or my collar grabbed. I would do better in a home without small children, although teenagers are okay. I have slight food and toy aggression and could use some training. I really enjoy going for long walks. My adoption fee is $185. Would you like to meet me and see how I would fit into your family?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm.

I am so sad and confused as to why I am at the shelter and not in a home anymore. If you have room in your family for a wonderful adult dog like me I would be eternally grateful. I promise I will be such a good girl! Since I have been at the shelter I have been very mellow, well-behaved and my kennel is always clean. I know how to sit and shake my paw. I am also learning how to play with other dogs, I like them but it makes me nervous if they are too rambunctious and jump\n\non me. Please apply for me today!

            "description": "Raddest Rover - Patty BSmokey is a 9 year old American Bulldog mix. When Smokey first came to Partners for Pets in 2012, he was rescued from a local animal control when his time was up. He was an owner surrender. Sadly, they loved him dearly, but were forced into public housing and couldn't take Smokey. He was adopted and loved for 8 long years until returning back to our shelter when his adopter sadly passed. We do not recommend children younger than 12 years old for Smokey. Now, he's looking for someone to love him in his golden years. He has so much life and love to give his forever family! Despite a silver muzzle, Smokey is a fun loving, playful and energetic boy. He gives THE BEST kisses and is such a joy to care for. He walks well on a leash and obeys simple commands. He loves people and other dogs. He is housebroken and would be a great fit in any family. Smokey is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, dewormed, heartworm negative and microchipped. Contact Partners to make Smokey part of your Furever Family today!\n\nThe adoption fee is $195.00. If you are interested, please fill out an online application at www.partnersforpetsil.org/applications.\n\nPlease visit our adoptable pets at PetSmart in O'Fallon, IL every Saturday of the month and at the PetSmart in Glen Carbon, IL every Sunday of the month. Our pets will be at PetSmart from 11:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.. If there is a dog in particular you would like to meet at PetSmart, be sure to email and inquire whether that dog will be at that particular PetSmart that day. Make your home a fur-ever home! 2/2/21 3:20 PM",

Im neutered, up to date on all my shots, crate trained, and I love to be with people! I can be a little anxious sometimes, so Im looking for a foster who is willing to work with me. Ive been told that Im very loyal and trusting once I get to know you, and Im great at the vet! Im not so good with small animals, but I wouldnt mind if my foster family had a nice female dog about my size for me to hang out with. I also like to chew bones and go on walks or hikes! Training has reached a bit of a plateau with me living in a boarding facility, so I hope to find a nice foster family or forever family soon so I can keep going!\" - Boomer --- Genae's Pittie Party Rescue is a 501c3 nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing the population of homeless pets by rescuing, caring for and adopting out healthy, happy domestic animals into loving homes.

Aster was not wearing a collar, and she was not microchipped.\n\nAster has a shiny dark brown/brindle short smooth coat with a patch of white on her chest, a few white toes on her paws, a long tail, and a beautiful face with hopeful trusting eyes, a black button nose, and large semi-erect ears. Aster has a gentle, easygoing personality. She appeared to have an affectionate disposition when we took preliminary photos in her kennel not long after her arrival shortly before closing time. Aster was quick to come to the gate of her kennel and also quite the lady as she waited patiently for attention. \n\nAster weighs 49.6 lbs.\n\nWe look forward to taking more flattering photos of Aster outdoors but hope that someone recognizes her and comes to take her home first :)\n\nIn compliance with the Ohio Revised Code, Aster will be held for three days so that her family will have an opportunity to reclaim her with proof of ownership.\n\nNOTE:  Since Aster was not reclaimed, she went home with a foster family on August 8, 2020 who plans to adopt her after she is spayed.  \n\nUPDATE: Aster (now called Bella Rose) was returned by her tearful foster family on January 29, 2021 because she wasn't doing well with a young child in their household.  \n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Nicholas is a handsome and friendly German shepherd mix - given the reddish hue to his coat, he could have some chow chow. He acts like a shepherd. He holds his head high, prances a little when he walks and the curled tail stays curled when he is happy -  he is usually happy. When Nicholas first arrived he had very little hair on his body from severe flea allergies. His luxurious coat came in except on his tail. He rubbed his curly tail on the dog door just from using it, and because it was hairless, the hair didn't come back as well on his tail. Because he came to us later in life, he was neutered later (upon arrival.) Therefore, it is best that he be placed with a female dog friend if there are other dogs in the home. He is non reactive to cats. \n\nWe are guessing that Nicholas could be 4 years old. He is very friendly with new people and likes to have a big fenced yard to explore and run around in. He is curious and is very people oriented. He is very smart and really wants to have a friend. He will bark at strangers but more as an alert \"Hey, there is a stranger here. Do you see that they are here?\" \n\nHe is a good snuggler, sleeps with people and likes to give kisses. He is okay on a leash - and we are walking him more to give him practice.  Nicholas was a former stray. He has had a rough life in a short period of time and yet, carries no ill will from it. He has been at the sanctuary for more than a year and keeps getting overlooked. He is a great dog. We are looking for a quality person/family to match with Nicholas.  \n\nIf you are interested in Nicholas, please fill out a pre adoption application that can be found on our website www.dogwoodfarmsanctuary.com or on our information page with Petfinders. From there we can start the conversation.",

He's going to to enjoy an active life style and will be a loyal, intelligent companion.  We are looking for a new owner that has experience with the breed and understands the temperament and needs of a border collie.  We think he would do best in a home with a fenced yard to give him a chance to run and play and get plenty of exercise.  His adoption fee is $350 to help cover the medical costs of getting ready for adoption.  For our application, please email rescuebc@hotmail.com.  Include your location and a phone number for future communication.\nThe first step in our process is to submit an application for review. Once approved, we will contact you to arrange a meeting at our next Meet and Greet event. Our pets are fostered in private homes and will be brought to Frederick, MD to meet approved adopters.",

            "description": "Duke is  2 year old Great Pyrenees in search of a new home through no fault of his own.  His owners jobs require them to be gone for long periods of time and they felt Duke deserved a home where he could get more attention.  He is a fun loving boy, who likes playing with other dogs.  He is good with all humans, however he is protective of his food bowl, so adopters must be prepared for a food protective dog.  He does like to chase cats, although he has never hurt one.  He rides well in a vehicle, and enjoys car rides.  He knows some basic commands, sit, shake and down, and walks well on a leash.  He prefers sleeping on a cool floor, and does not much care for dog beds, however, he does enjoy sofas, and likes to lay on his back with all his legs in the air.   Duke would like a home with another dog. We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nDuke will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350",

This dog is expected to graduate from Paws in Prison on 9/25. The dogs in this program are trained under the AKC Canine Good Citizen standards and are specifically selected to be family and companion dogs. They spend 24 hours a day with their trainers. For that reason, they will do best in homes where they are primarily inside dogs and spend lots of time with their families. The adoptive family will receive their training journal.

We have no idea what his mix is but he looks like a long legged boxer mix. We are also guessing his age around 2 years old. \n\nWe don\u2019t know much about Carson because he was found dumped in the local state forest with a bag of dog food. He wouldn\u2019t come to anyone but he stayed in sight and barked at people trying to help him. He was waiting for his \u201cperson\u201d to return for him but that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Luckily, he was easy to trap in about an hour. Once out of the trap, Carson was friendly with his rescuers. It is clear that Carson hasn\u2019t had a good life. His neck is stained gray from a metal chain being wrapped around it and his ears have been eaten by flies. \n\nWe are still getting to know Carson and will update this listing as we get to know him better. He deserves to be put first for a change. \n\nCarson was neutered 8/4 and is current on vaccines and heartworm prevention since his test was negative. He is also on flea and tick prevention. \n\nUPDATE 9/5: Carson has not done well with male dogs but has done ok when tested with a female dog. We have not yet tried small dogs or cats. We suspect he spent a very large portion of his life chained alone and wasn\u2019t properly socialized. He will be a work in progress in that aspect. He mainly needs practice! A meet and greet with a female dog will be required. \n\nUPDATE 9/25: Carson continues to show his love for people and how happy he is to be taken care of! He is still doing ok with only bigger female dogs.\n\nIf you would like to donate toward his care our PayPal address is hswcin@blueriver.net. We are 501c3 and provide tax receipts upon request.",

I\u2019m the strong , friendly type. I don\u2019t like to be crated. I prefer to be free so I will most likely need my new family to be home with me.  I\u2019m having some balance issues that the puppy doctor is checking out so I\u2019m not 100% available yet. I\u2019m already neutered so I come with no baggage! I\u2019m not keen on the kitties and I\u2019m reactive to other pups. If you\u2019d like to meet me, contact The Healthy Hearts and Paws Project.\n\nLicks and tail wags, Rutger ??",

            "description": "Sanctuary Update : Bozworth has been a very sweet and loving guy with the entire staff. He is a big sweet goof that loves attention. He and our big alpha girl Nikki get along extremely well and can fully be trusted to be alone with each other, although we do feed them separately to be safe. Bosworth has been trained to jump into his crate at meal time and can stay in the crate for some time after without putting up any fuss. He had some issues with house training in a foster home, but now being able to use the crate as a training tool will certainly come in handy! When walking by the other dog yards he does get worked up and attempt to fence fight with them if allowed, so it would be ideal for his person to be strong and training minded especially if you live in an area where he could encounter them on walks etc. but the ideal home for Bosworth would be in a country setting with dog savvy folks, either as an only dog or with one other female dog that he has proven to get along well with during a meet and greet here at the sanctuary. Big, loving and handsome guy! \n\nBio before sanctuary transfer: Handsome, big white Shepherd. He is easy going, and a good walking partner. Though he pulls initially, he calms down. Gentle and sweet with children, loves rides in the car. A loving and loyal addition for a family or couple with time to share with their dog. Bozworth lives with a BIG GIRL Nikki and does great, though in a home he likely will be better solo, he can have some attitude towards other dogs - if he is to be mixed, he needs a strong, dog savvy person with ability to do proper introductions, and read his body language - first he needs to know he is not in charge. Bozworth has a totally charming side to him - but he is not for the new initiate or the faint of heart! A big love with people, if you have a property and want a large presence who is also a sweetheart he's a great candidate!\n\n *Foster Return* 11/15/15 \"Bozworth loves to travel in vehicles and go on car rides. Needs more socializing with other dogs. Loves to chew on toys.\" If interested in this sweet guy please email an application to sanctuary@milofoundation.org\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

She was found under the floorboards of an abandoned house in Coconut Grove with her 9 puppies. Catana has a very difficult time trusting people. She shakes and paces when a new person enters her space. Our trainers and volunteers, as well as, the veterinarian staff continue to work with her and she's making progress slowly. However, we see a very different Catana when she's around another dog. She LOVES dogs! Catana's true personality comes out. She's playful and gives them kisses. It's amazing and wonderful to see her be a dog. This is why we feel it is so important for her to have a canine sibling. Catana will need a very special foster/adopter. They will need to be patient and dedicated. They will need to earn her trust by spending lots of time with her, even before she leaves the rescue. It will be a lengthy process, but you could be her savior.",

            "description": "Goliath is his name, but, if we're going to be honest, that applies more to the love he has to give, since he's actually a medium-sized dog. He's only 2 years-old, and he's a very handsome Border Collie / Rottweiler mix that absolutely adores his people. He loves to play and explore, and hopes to have a backyard of his very own where he can run zoomies to his heart's content. Which makes the fact that he's spent more than 6 months here at HSHC even harder, because, as our fosters have told us, he instantly relaxes and his stress melts away as soon as he gets into a home environment.\n\nHe's exquisitely housebroken, and will let you know when he needs to go outside for a potty break. He's also been professionally trained, and knows commands that he will be so proud to show you when you meet him. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! Goliath's adoption comes with a FREE bonus from our friends and Annual Corporate Sponsors at Paws & Play which includes five (5) days of in-home training OR training on site at Paws & Play in addition to seven (7) days of lodging, so you'll have the chance to teach him even more great tricks and commands with the help of professionals from Paws & Play, all for FREE. \n\nHis ideal home would have any children be at least 10 years-old so they can help him practice all his tricks and commands, and he would prefer to be the only pet in his home, as he wants to be the main squeeze for all his people.\n\nWe're asking for your help in finding this good boy the home he deserves. If you are working from home and would like a companion to join you and liven up your days and give you a reason to take a nice walk outside, why not come meet him? Or, if you know a family that has been looking for a dog that might be a good fit for Goliath, please share his profile with them.\n\nWe know that his people are out there, and that they'll be so happy to have him, they just don't know it yet. Help us help him find his family.",

            "description": "Zoe Mary Ann, born approximately November 2019 came to TGPR in May 2020. She and her sister were found in the country trying to survive.  Sister Ginger was adopted quite quickly but Zoe was just so anxious and is trying to adjust to living the good life!! \n\nZoe MA may warm up slowly but is very affectionate once she knows you.  She has learned the lead, is house trained and is playful. She needs a family who will take the time to allow her to be comfortable.  She is not a traditional pyr but has the dew claws and white sleek coat. \n\nTexas Great Pyrenees Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to Great Pyrenees. We have the best selection of Pyrs in Texas and we do home checks and vet checks before placement. We start with adoption applications (no cost/obligation) and we make placements on a first submitted-first approved basis. If you are interested in giving this dog a new home, please complete an adoption form found at http://www.txpyrs.org",

            "description": "Date of birth: 7/2015\n\n12/17/2020: Hercules is a beautiful Husky/Collie mix! He\u2019s 5 years old and weighs 60 lbs. Hercules is a diamond in the ruff! He\u2019s exhibited behavior that makes us believe the poor guy had been left outdoors without a lot of human companionship. But he\u2019s made tons of progress over the past few months we\u2019ve worked with him! He's become playful and animated now that he's settled in. He\u2019s bright and funny.  We\u2019re seeing a dog who will be an amazing companion with some guidance and a loving home. \n\n\u2022 Hercules will need a home with someone who has dog experience and is dog savvy with dogs who are under socialized. He can be fearful with strangers, especially men, so needs work in that area to become more trusting. He would not be a good match if you are looking for your first dog as an adult.\n\n\u2022 He likes most other dogs and enjoys playing in the yard with other dogs.  If you have a dog you could bring your dog to meet Hercules to see if they could be buddies.\n\n\u2022 He needs a home without kids or cats.\n\n\u2022 He doesn\u2019t like to be restrained and he's sensitive about excessive touching. He will let you brush him once he trusts you. He's made a lot of progress in this area, however, and we expect that with some patience he'll greatly improve once he's in a home.\n\n\u2022 He is crate trained and he kennels up well.\n\n\u2022 He loves to smell things when he goes on walks.\n\n\u2022 He can be a barker, so needs a house vs an apartment or condo, etc.\n\n\u2022 Hercules will require some patience and training to make up for whatever he\u2019d experienced during his first 5 years. But he\u2019s a smart, sweet, playful guy with a lot of personality and he\u2019ll blossom in the right home! He's really a lot of fun!\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s been neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. He tested positive for heartworms, but has finished treatment and has no restrictions.\n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

            "description": "PATCH IS AT THE ADOPTION CENTER OF FAMILY DOG RESCUE. Email adopt@ilovefamilydog.org to inquire!\n\nMostly, Patch is just a handsome, chill, big sweetheart who wants attention, to play fetch or to sleep near his people. He is clearly well trained and responds very well to hand signals (come, sit, down, stay, no, and even shake). He was crate-trained, so settled happily into the crate as his space. He figured out the dog door in a day or 2 and he's been a perfect house guest. He is at my side everywhere I go and at my feet when I'm sitting. He does get on the couch when he thinks no one is looking, and will sleep by the front door when we're gone, so careful opening the door (deaf dogs are deep sleepers!) He's had a couple nights where he randomly barks in his sleep, but quiets down if we touch him. He had a bath, which he did not enjoy but was very tolerant of and he lets me brush him, but he'd rather be playing ball. He's good in the car and in the yard, totally housebroken (no issues at all) and not at all destructive, no interest in chewing even rawhides. Aside from some growling at strangers, he's been great on walks and with the kids. He and Scout had to work out some boundaries over food and contact with me, but it never escalated beyond warning growls/barks and now they actually play together, which is fun to watch. I think he's fine with another dog (once they work out territory/dominance) and my guess is he would mostly ignore a cat, but he would def chase down a squirrel if given the chance! \n\n He's been good with our older (pre-teen) kids, but I'd be a little cautious with small children bc he does bark/growl when startled (he's deaf, so that happens) and that can be scary for a little one. Overall, he would be a perfect dog for anyone who can give him a little time and patience up front as he settles in. He is a lover and a cuddler and clearly wants to please. Active and interested in everything he sees, social and outgoing, an Australian Cattledog with a full tail. Patch is bright and smart, however, he is also deaf. He has learned the hand signals for many commands, and responds to certain touches. Best for a home without or at least with older children (teens) - he is not great with cats - though with a commitment to training and consistency - he could learn . . . bright, precocious, agile and eager to get on with life and learning! Patch will need a lot of outdoor activity, playing fetch and other games. Also right now he needs toys and things to chew on and carry around . . . also, he loves other dogs! Former sanctuary caretaker's bio: \"Oh my, what can I say? The greatest dog I have ever slept with. He goes down like a stone at bed time, and being deaf, he does not hear a thing, and is a big time snuggler. He goes into his crate on command. He is a handsome devil to be sure, really a good looking dog. He is an obsessive ball chaser. Patch jumps up and nips... your sleeve, your pant leg. He is full of energy. He is vocal and high strung. Patch is one of my favorite dogs at the sanctuary, and lucky would be the person who becomes his friend. He is not easy, and he is not for everyone, but he is a fine dog. Patch is a commitment, not just a dog, but as with most commitments, there is work involved, and rewards. \" \n\nFormer foster home: \"He currently knows a few basic hand signals such as sit, down, stay, no, come, and we're currently working on watch. For sit, we have been using the palm up signal. Start with you palm low and facing the sky, then raise your palm to the level of your chin. For Down, start with your palm face down at the level of your face and lower your hand to the level of your waist. For come, we kneel down and hold out both of our hands and wiggled our wriste back and forth quickly. Even when we call over Patch when he is being bad, we never punish him if he comes over when he is being called. For no, we hold our the pointing finger facing the sky and quickly move the wriste back and forth once in front of his face (which sometimes shocks him). Patch likes to jump so when he does we turn around and don't pay attention to him. For stay, I put my palm face down in front of his face and and hold it there for 2 seconds (I do this from a sit position). I do this when I put a treat in front of him. Then when I tap the ground right next to the treat with my pointing finger twice (quickly), that's when he knows that he can get the treat. We have also been working on watch. This is where I put Patch in a sit position, take a treat and hold it in front of his nose, then slowly bring the treat up to between my eyes so that he ends up looking at me. Patch also really likes to chase cars. His collar should always be tight on him when he gets walked. We currently use a harness because he likes to chase cars so much. When he sees cars, he sometimes starts to back up a lot, which can cause him to break out of a regular collar. He also really likes to chew so he will need a LOT of toys to play with. For feeding, we're currently giving him 1.5 cups in the morning and 1 cup a night. We found out if he eats more than a cup for dinner he will have to poop in the middle of the night. Patch also loves to get his ears rubbed and sometimes likes being held. \" \n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioural \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.\n************************************",

            "description": "Zoey joined the rescue a little over a week ago and we are getting to know her. She got all checked over at the vet clinic then moved to her Illinois foster home where she is working on getting comfortable with all of the new sights, smells and activity. She is a super sweet girl who is very loving to all humans that she meets. Due to her age and deafness. we will require that Zoey go to a family with older/dog savvy children. She has also not done well when meeting other four-legged friends, so a home with no other pets will likely be her happy place. 9/5 UPDATED FROM ZOEY'S FOSTER MOM: Zoey is the epitome of sweet. She's loving and loyal, cuddly, gentle and utterly adorable. She is not aggressive or angry whatsoever; she's assertive. We've handled her while she's eating, sleeping, playing, and relaxing, and she's nonplussed. We've touched her paws, face and 2 small growths and she doesn't flinch. We've brushed her teeth, snuck Benedryl into cheese without her spitting anything out (for a reaction to CBH oil), and she even handled a bee sting on her paw with grace. She's not obsessed with her dog food but she eats her 2 meals when she's ready; watch out if you have hard boiled eggs, chicken and CHEESE. She has playful moments, and those usually consist of her zooming around for a couple of minutes a day or grabbing a toy to have thrown and chase down. She does fine with baths and car rides. What she loves more than anything are her humans: her family. She has slept in bed with her adult humans for her entire life, so she would have it no other way in her foster home (she is stubborn and her human fosters need sleep). She does make for a great snooze buddy, though, and has manners: she is neither a bed-hog NOR a snorer. She's potty trained and will sit by the door when she needs to go out, however, she has a schedule and typically doesn't ask for extra trips outside of that. She will always poop on her walks, sometimes 2-3 full loads, so have bags on hand! She does have a little extra pull on the leash, but it seems like correcting with food (human treats, not dog treats) will get her to a slack lead. Zoey does have some quirks, and nearly all of them are most likely a result of her being deaf. She reacts with barking and running towards people approaching the house (and sometimes a large truck driving past), probably because she overcompensates for not hearing and assumes these people need a warning from her. She will trot happily into her crate and even naps with the door open at times, but only when one of her humans are in the room. She'll even lie down and sleep with the door closed sometimes, as long as someone is near. If she's left in her crate and there is nobody in her sights, she panics and escapes, sometimes getting hurt in the process. She probably needs to have her humans near so she feels safe and panics when they are not near. She needs to be crated when humans are not home because the panic drives her to be destructive and potentially hurt herself also. She would not do well in a house with kids younger than teenagers, and she'd be the best dog family member to a home without other pets, as she has a strong prey drive (squirrels, cats, pet birds, pet guinea pig) and becomes defensive around other dogs. Ideally she'd be a long-distance truck driver's ultimate companion or in a family when at least one person is always home. Future homes will need to continue to work with Zoey on feeling safe in her crate when her people are gone and redirecting her focus from what she's barking at to themselves for reassurance. What Zoey isn't great with are outweighed by the positives ten-fold.Zoey Boxer: Silly (she needs to have a toy or something in her mouth when she greets you, so she'll search for something while bent in half, or kidney beaning). Sweet (she is a cuddly, snuggly, gentle love who also LOVES giving kisses, even to the air if you hold her back--file that under silly, too). Smart. (She knows the signs for sit, stay, come, no, and good girl. She goes right into a sit when a treat is pulled out. She learned our routines in our house immediately and adapted quickly). Sassy. (she has fun with bursts of fetch and zoomies and will nudge you a bit with her face to get you to play if she's ready and you're not). Sleepy. (She loves to snooze and cuddle for naps and also sleeps through the night...yes, I'm a mom to a human, too, so this still means a lot to me). Stylish. (she has sweaters for the winter AND she has a heart-shaped spot on her nose .",

            "description": "IN FOSTER THRU FAMILY DOG RESCUE. Email adopt@ilovefamilydog.org to inquire!\n\nWhat a beautiful, active and happy girl! Nakita is all smiles and absolutely loves people. She has lived with other dogs - notably our deaf Heeler mix boy Patchy, but typically she can be a handful around other dogs. Super dominant, and not good around them on leash, possibly pairing with a submissive, playful male could work in a large space. She is a loving girl looking for a breed-savvy adopter. She gets along nicely with all people and some friendly male dogs, but no females or dog parks for this pretty girl. She does NOT do well when meeting dogs through a barrier or on leash, but with proper direction this could possibly improve. Her ideal adopter would either have experience with leash reactive dogs or would be prepared to work with trainers to help her react more appropriately when seeing other dogs on leash. She believes all the food in the world is hers and while she doesn't act aggressively with people or dogs regarding food, she has no problem taking food that doesn't belong to her and will happily knock them over to make this a reality. For this reason she does need to be separated from other dogs during feeding time and should never be \"free fed\". Nakita's previous owners mentioned she could be quite the escape artist as she is very good at jumping fences, because of this she is in need of a home that has very good fencing and owners with the ability to get her the mental stimulation, and physical activity a smart energetic girl like her needs. However, she has not tried or been able to escape from our six foot fences here at the Sanctuary. It is very easy to fall in love with her beautiful face and completely charming personality, but before applying please do stop to think if you would be able to give her the exercise and training that she would need in order to reach her full potential. She needs someone who is comfortable with taking the lead. Someone who will love her and always treat her compassionately, but will set very clear and consistent rules, which they are willing to stick to when she decides to test and challenge them. We are looking for a home for her with someone who understands that although they are fluffy and adorable, Husky's are a unique kind of dog and can be a challenge if not trained properly. If you feel that you can offer this girl the loving home that she so deserves, please send your application to sanctuary@milofoundation.org\n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog.\nOur Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioural issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments.\nThese are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. \nBUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.\n\nNakita has been at Family Dog Rescue since our Evacuation of our Sanctuary. Please email\nadopt@ilovefamilydog.org to set up a meet and greet!",

When Cajun came to us, it was clear he had no previous introduction to toys or fun. Now all Cajun wants to do is play!! He is a very fun guy looking for someone willing to teach him how to be a dog, as he has little to no guidance previously. Cajun could also benefit from someone willing to teach him basic commands and how to walk on leash. He is  shy at first and can be a bit reactive to strangers but will warm up with slow introductions, especially when play is involved. He loves water and will chase a water hose all day long! Cajun has not been tested with kids or cats but seems to do well with other playful dogs. \n\n\nADOPTION FEE AND HEALTH INFORMATION\n\nUpon adoption, they will have received: age appropriate vaccines (DA2PP vaccine), (Bordetella vaccine), (Rabies vaccine), up to date on flea/tick prevention, spay or neuter of pet, deworming, and microchip.\n\n\nAPPLY\n\nAren't they sweet? Wondering what's next?\n\nYou MUST fill out an application to adopt. Please copy and paste the URL to start adoption application.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/200145864739157\n\n\nOnce you have submitted an application, we do our best to work efficiently to process them. We will call you with any questions we have. In the meantime, you can come by and meet the dog you're interested in.\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nQ: Where are you located?\nA: We are located just on the Arkansas - Missouri border at 32 Bella Vista Way, Bella Vista Arkansas.\n\n\nQ: I would like to set up a meet and greet!\nA: Please fill out an application! This is the first step to see if the dog you chose is a great fit for your home.\n\n\nQ: I have more questions!! Who do I contact?\nA: Please call 479-855-6020 or email bvas@sbcglobal.net\n\n\nQ: I am under 18, will you adopt to me?\nA: Unfortunately, we do not adopt to anyone under the age of 18.\n\n\nQ: I would like to surprise my family with a dog! Can I do this?\nA: Unfortunately, no. If there is more than one decision-maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration and for helping the dogs and puppies in need!",

She was so frightened when I attempted to rescue her and her sisters that I couldn't even touch her. She's come so far. These pups were born outside 15 feet from a very busy road. It's a miracle that they made it out of there. \n\nI'm looking for a loving , calm home for Truvy. Her person will need to be patient, gentle and understanding. There is a good reason for the fear she is working throug & it may take some time for this beautiful hound to feel safe & secure. If you are a black & tan coonhound lover and are fairly dog savy this is your girl. \n\nPlease text me at 423-653-9895 to request our adoption questionnaire. We will set up a time for your meet/greet.",

I found this out when my 2 y.o. grandchild was here visiting and she chased him around the back yard biting his butt :). Therefore, we will not adopt Petra out to families with small children or cats. Although we haven't tested her with cats, I feel her drive to herd will make her a nuisance to them.Petra is a great girl, gets along well with other dogs, appears housebroken, and is the perfect size for those of you with smaller homes or requirements. Great mix of loving, calm, and playful all in one ready to go package :)Petra would LOVE to have a fenced in yard and another canine playmate :)Petra is heartworm positive and we have begun treatment..We will do a foster to adopt for her during this for anyone interested in adopting.",

I wonder if she gets radio signals through those fabulous ears??? Peanut is just that, a peanut! Petite and perfectly proportioned, Peanut is all tail waggy at the prospect of going for a walk. She shows off her housetraining skills the moment we're out the door and then walks, stops, surveys, walks, stops, surveys as we head to the park. It's almost as if she's saying to herself - this looks very familiar. And indeed it should, as Peanut, born approx December 2013, she's playful, sweet, comes when called, sits (sometimes) and takes treats gently. She gives sweet kisses and loves to be pet. Although Peanut did well on her behavior assessment,(she jumped up to cuddle and hug the assessor at the end) based on reports from her previous adopter it's recommended that Peanut go into an adult only home or with older respectful kids. No other dogs or small children. She'll make an awesome companion and a perfect lap dog, so if you're looking for a fun, low key and friendly little girl, ask for Peanut today.

            "description": "We recently welcomed back a former PLP momma, Nellie. She first joined us in December 2016 and gave birth two babies in our care (Clark and Ellen). The puppies found wonderful families and Nellie went to an awesome foster home to work on becoming the carefree girl she was meant to be. She was a timid girl who had known little kindness before coming to us, and it showed. With her foster family, Nellie\u2019s confidence grew, and she blossomed into a silly, playful, fun-loving girl. She went on lots of adventures, learned that the world wasn\u2019t such a scary place, and that cuddling with her human friends and playing with her canine pals were pretty much the best things ever.\n\nThe following Spring, Nellie found what we thought was her forever home, but not everything goes as planned. For unknown reasons, Nellie became terrified of her human dad. She shook out of fear when he was present and started to lose weight from the stress. Sadly, we\u2019ll never know why Nellie became so fearful of a person she lived with for over 2 years, but we are glad she\u2019s back with us. She deserves to live a life full of fun, not fear. She rejoined her foster family from three years ago and is back to the silly, playful girl we know. \n\nNellie is ready to find her forever family and needs someone who will be patient and understanding of her timid nature. Once she\u2019s your friend, she\u2019s a totally different, goofy, playful, crazy girl. She does best with a confident canine pal, so another large dog in the home is a must. This girl likes to play hard! She also loves to cuddle with her family, both two and four legged. As for kitties, we\u2019re not sure, so a feline free home would be best for her.\n\nTo meet Nellie, please visit our website, www.pittieslovepeace.com, to submit an adoption application. Nellie is spayed, microchipped and vaccinated. Her adoption fee is $250.00 and includes doggie kisses and a lifetime of LOVE. \n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing a predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

Forrest\u2019s finder brought him to RRR when they could not find his owner and did not readily have a foster to house him.  A big shout out to For Pet\u2019s Sake for helping with Forrest\u2019s initial vetting!!!  Forrest is a young loving boy, who wants to please, but is still learning his manners around people and other dogs. He is approximately one year old and is a Black and Tan German Shepherd.\n\nForrest  has been neutered and tested for heartworms and intestinal parasites.  He is current on his vaccinations, deworming, heartworm prevention and Flea and Tick Prevention.  We are still working on getting Forrest\u2019s weight up as he was quite thin and had parasites when he came to us.   \n\nForrest will need an active home where he could go walking, running or hiking with his new family.  Forrest\u2019s new family will need to be committed to taking him through training courses.  We would like to see Forrest go to a home with a large privacy fenced yard to play and run in.  As Forrest still has a lot of \u2018puppy\u2019 in him, to keep him out of trouble while you are away, he will need to be crated or kenneled. Forrest may do fine with older dog savvy children, but he may accidentally knock over younger children. We are working with Forrest with other dogs. He may not do well with all dogs, but we are working on learning more about the personality of dogs that may work as a playmate for Forrest!\n\nForrest is available for foster to adopt or immediate adoption. Forrest\u2019s adoption fee is $400 and includes a microchip.  Come meet his handsome boy today!\n\nTo request an Adoption Application, email rescue@southwesthospital.com. \n\nRecycled Rovers Rescue reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. \n\nPlease be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come-first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care. \n\nPriority will be given to local applicants and previous adopters.",

            "description": "Hello, I'm Beau and I am a 3 year old Shepherd mix! I am about 93 lbs.\n \nMy friends at Pawmetto Lifeline would describe me as big and beautiful. I LOVE to play fetch and can do it all day - every day. I love treats and will do whatever trick in the book it takes for you to give me one. I even take treats gently - what other 93 lb dog will do that!\n\nI was adopted out from Pawmetto Lifeline as an 8 week old puppy and was returned three years later. My adopters told Pawmetto Lifeline that when they adopted me, they had picked the perfect dog. Pawmetto Lifeline does not know what happened in those three years but since then, I am a little insecure. I need comfort and security knowing that my toys are mine, so if you're willing to buy toys that are just for me and no one else - I would greatly appreciate it. I am basically a teenager in dog years.. what teenager doesn't want to keep his things to himself? \n\nI would feel most comfortable in a home without children under 18 as I am not too fond of commotion in the home. It would be best to have a fenced in back yard. I would love to have an experienced dog owner who is confident and can handle a dog as smart as I am. I would like to be the star of your life and of your home - being an only child is alright with me. I would do best in the home with someone who is willing to work with me and show me that the world isn't scary, that I am safe, and that I am loved. Patience is everything - please allow me to take my time warming up to you, even if that means no belly scratches or any sort of touch until I feel comfortable. I need someone that is okay with that transition taking longer than a week - I need time to develop my bond with you but I promise my love will be worth it. \n \nMy adoption fee of $200 includes my up-to-date vaccinations, microchip, deworming, and I come home spayed/neutered. I even started on my monthly flea and heartworm preventatives - what more could you ask for? \n\nMy adoption is considered \"Best Match\". This means that I am looking for a specific type of home or certain qualities in my new family. I am not first come-first serve for any approved applicant. Pawmetto Lifeline's adoption advocates and my case managers would love to review your application to see if we are a BEST MATCH! I appreciate your patience as the Adoption team discusses your application with my case managers!\n \nIf you'd like to meet me, please fill out an application on our website, PawmettoLifeline.org, and an adoption advocate will be with you shortly. Thank you!",

Daisy has been well socailized and Daisy is good with dogs of all sizes and small children. She can be shy with new people but will warm up with patience and a gentle touch. Daisy may be an itty bitty pitty mix, but she has a heart of gold and wouldn't hurt a flea. She has a sweet and submissive personality with people and other dogs. Daisy will make a wonderful new best friend for young or old!\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

She was SO excited to be rescued from a kill shelter in west Texas and knows that she's on to bigger and better things! She's been used and abused for breeding purposes, her ears were butchered via an at home crop job and it's obvious the world she knows hasn't been kind. The kindest thing her \"owners\" ever did for her was surrender her to the shelter. However to meet her you would never know! She LOVES all humans and dogs she's met and is literally one of the most grateful and unconditionally loving dogs EVER. Dogs are amazing and Tallie proves that with every booty shake! Tallie has now learned the ways of the indoor house dog and has 100% embraced couch life. She also LOVES toys, she's not so good on sharing, as she's never had any to share so that is going to take a little work. She adores food and her \"zoomies\" are an experience that cannot be properly explained. She's so insanely happy and grateful we cannot wait to meet her special FURever family because they are going to be fantastic! \n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.) \n\n \n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our VOICEMAIL at (402)957-1578",

This low-riding bully loves to play; he will chase balls and roughhouse, and loves to go for walks. Loki is still a puppy and needs guidance to work on his manners. He loves other dogs, but his size and energy can be too much for some without a structured introduction. \n\nLoki is great for training though! He is food motivated, makes lots of eye contact, and is eager to make you happy. He would do best in a home with no small children.\n\nAll of our dogs come fully-vaccinated, temperament-tested, and resources to set you and your dog up for success when adopting. Thank you for your support of our rescue!",

She would love a home where she is the center of attention, no other pets, and no children under the age of 12. She will chase lightning bugs all night. Loves to snuggle once she lays down, does very well in her crate. She walks on a leash well, however, she does lunge after animals nearby. She loves toys and isn't possessive of them. Gloria is an active dog and needs a place to run, she will not do well being in her crate for long periods of time. When she is out of her crate she follows you around and is your shadow for most of the day. She is potty trained for the most part, only has accidents in the house every once in awhile. She seems to be very trainable, eager to please. 4-5 years young. Heartworm positive, as well as a torn ACL.\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

Elmer does well with dogs on the calmer side, he would be fine with 1 or 2 other dogs in the home, but gets overwhelmed if it's a larger pack. He would do well with someone who has a calm lifestyle. Elmer has been professionally trained and he knows basic commands and is great on a leash. His story started very sad as he was given away to someone who dumped him and he had to survive on his own for a couple months before he was rescued.

He was dumped out of a vehicle off a very busy freeway, and thankfully a good samaritan saw him dropped off and rescued him before getting killed on the road. \nMango is a wonderful boy who loves people & children, does well with most dogs his size, and is learning to ignore the cats when on a leash. Although he is a Malinois, he has a calmness about him. He prefers to be in the house with his people and when they leave. If left outside alone, he will jump the fence. Mango is house trained and is good indoors. He loves his crate when left at home. We are looking for someone with a large dog experience because he is still a Malinois. He is a fantastic rodent hunter & athlete! \n\nPlease help us find Mango a family of his own.\n\nAdoption donation fee and home inspection required. \nApplication for adopting and fostering -   https://form.jotform.com/201328449376157\n\nThank you, \nDharma DOG Movement\nAwareness | Advocacy | Saving Lives\n\nIf you have any questions about fostering or adopting, please contact Dharma Dog Movement directly at adopt@dharmadogmovement.org\n\n08/2020\n\n\n",

June had a name tag on with a phone number, The people on the opposite end of the phone declared they did not own such a dog. Strange. She is super sweet, lovable and a cuddler. She loves her walks. We can't seem to gage how she is with other dogs since she was growley when they approached. She was in heat, so that may have contributed to her behaviour. June Bug is a total catch. She is around 3.5 years old and weighs 75 pounds. \nAll dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE group session with our amazing trainer to his Street Obedience Class is included and not to be missed.We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.  We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. Thank you for looking at a rescue dog for your next family member!

Our veterinary partner estimates that Henry was 3 years old at the time of intake in February 2020. After treatment with our vet partner, Henry is all healed up, packed up and ready to go to his forever home. Oh wait, this poor boy doesn't yet have a forever home! Can you help us out with that? Henry is\na sweet, funny lapdog.\n\nunderstandably timid but is coming out of his shell in his foster home. He is fearful of men, so he needs a kind, gentle forever mom who lives in a quiet suburb without a lot of street traffic, and who is home most of the time as Henry doesn't like to be alone. If there are children, they should be on the older side so they understand that Henry is easily spooked. Henry is housetrained, loves to cuddle and snuggle and will bond with his person.

She found her way to a family and played with the children, but she chased their cats. She is a real beauty and wants to be loved.  Great for an active dog for hiking and traveling. She needs more training to be comfortable being out in public, but with a confident handler and more experience being in public, she settles down and would be a great \u201croad dog.\u201d \n\nPlease help us find this amazing dog a forever home with their own family.\n\nAdoption donation fee and home inspection required. \nApplication for adopting and fostering -   https://form.jotform.com/201328449376157\n\nThank you, \nDharma DOG Movement\nAwareness | Advocacy | Saving Lives\n\nIf you have any questions about fostering or adopting, please contact Dharma Dog Movement directly at adopt@dharmadogmovement.org\n\n08/2020\n\n",

            "description": "Annie is a very pretty, beige-colored 3 yr. old terrier mix.  She weighs about 10 lbs.  She can be a little timid at first, but boy does she come alive!  She's friendly, bouncy, and playful!  She gets along in general with dogs of both sexes, but can be pushy at times and bossy with smaller ones.  She has a moderate energy level and loves chasing her toys, playing with her dog friends, and chasing a little tennis ball outside.  She's housetrained, crate trained and leash trained.  She LOVES well-behaved, dog savvy children.  She would do best in a home with a compatible, playful canine companion.  Annie's adoption fee is $300.  LOCAL ADOPTION ONLY.\n\nThis dog may be at one of the Prescott pet stores on Sat. If you're interested, please call in advance to confirm that we're bringing this dog and where we'll be.

Azura is mostly afraid of cats and tolerant of other dogs but has a tendency to get attached to her humans and guard them. She has some jealousy issues. Zurie will need a home that is experienced and can help her learn that this is not an acceptable behavior.East TN Pit Bull Rescue adopts out to companion homes only. Adoptions require an application that is verified, a meeting that includes ALL members of the household, a home visit, and a trial period.

All of our dogs are placed as inside pets, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, vaccinations current, and HW- or treated within the last 6 months for heart worms by our vet. Adoption fees start at $150 for adults and $200 for pups.

In his former home, Brix was a livestock guardian dog, but he would rather hang out with his people than with livestock all day, and is looking for a change in lifestyle. Since coming into rescue, Brix has settled in nicely with his foster family. He proves to be a playful companion to his foster siblings, especially those similar in size to him. He loves being around people, and he shows his affection by leaning all his weight on you until you give in and shower him with head scratches and ear rubs :) Brix is eager to make new friends - he is always among the \"welcome committee\" whenever friends and neighbors come to visit. These days, Brix is busy enjoying life as a companion dog, learning house manners, and romping around with his foster siblings. Brix is looking for an active family who will take the time to train him in house manners and the necessary skills to be a companion dog, and one who can engage him in an appropriate amount of activities to allow him to channel his energy in a positive manner. With patience and love, Brix will thrive and mature into your loyal buddy who will not leave your side!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

Now they need a great home where they'll get all the love and attention they deserve, and can stay together forever.  Kayne, a 2 1/2 year old boxer mix, and his mom, Ryla, a 5 year old pit mix, were abandoned in a trailer by their puppy mill owner.  He took Ryla's 2 week old puppies from her and left the pair with no food or water for weeks.  Thankfully they were rescued, and they are so incredibly happy now.  These two love everyone they meet and love each other too.  They're both attention-hogs, they very affectionate, playful, well-behaved, and housebroken.  They need a home with no other pets.  They'll bring so much happiness to the good family that welcomes them home!

            "description": "Adopting an older dog is one of the greatest acts of love and kindness you could ever express. This precious girl is Angel. In January of 2015, Angel thought she had found her forever home. A single guy and she was his only girl. Things were great and Angel was happy. Then came the girlfriend and her life forever changed. It wasn't a jealous girlfriend issue like most thought. Angel loved the new person in the house. So much that she began to prefer her attention over his. You might say it was a jealous man issue. Soon his jealousy turned to anger and that scared Angel even more. He had enough! He packed up Angel and took her back to the rescue from which he adopted her. Angels beloved new friend came along and it was a tearful goodbye. It is so hard to understand. He was the adult, the human, the supposed Pack Leader. But a jealous heart turned against Angel all because Angel chose to love another. But this is not the end of the story. In the 5 years that Angel was with her owner, never once was she taken to the vet. No check ups, no vaccines, no preventions. Once Angel was back in the care of her former rescue, she was immediately taken to the vet. Luck would have it that Angel had her own Angel watching over her. She got a great check up, all her vaccines and was heart worm negative. Now Angel waits. Is there a real forever home for this precious girl? Angel is now 8.5 years old. She weighs around 60 lb and is considered a Staffordshire mix. Angel has not been around another dog in over 5 years and doesn't know how to interact. It would be best it she found a home where she was the one and only. She deserves all the attention to make up for the years she has lost.",

She is still a little depressed and missing her mom but she\u2019s slowly getting better. So far, Dora likes to lay on her bed most of the day and will come around for a few head scratches occasionally. She does like to sit in laps but not for long. She does have some food aggression issues so we feed her by herself. She is also a climber. She is very resourceful and will use whatever she can to climb up high. She can be grumpy towards other dogs at times but I think once she gets more comfortable that will change. She does fine with cats and will even let them eat out of her food bowl. Dora is a very sweet girl with a broken heart. Once she starts to feel safe we think she will make a fun, sweet and loyal companion. Dora also needs a home with no children as they startle her and she doesn\u2019t like that.\n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA. \n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

She has eyes and a sweetness about her that will melt your heart. She is shy and timid at first but warms up very fast and will quickly jump in your lap and smother you with kisses. She is not fully leash or house trained and does have some separation anxiety that she needs to work through. So Nina needs to be in a home with someone that is around often to help work with her on crate training and improving her separation anxiety, the more you baby her the worse it gets. So someone that has the strength in themselves to help her build confidence is what she needs. She does do well with other dogs her size that are calm.  She would do great with an active person since she is extremely energetic and LOVES her walks!\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

He was adopted for a short period, then returned when the adopter said that he as allergic to the grass in his yard. He is a very active fella who enjoys to rip and race during playgroups. He does well with other dogs but is a rough goofy player and needs a playmate that can keep up with him. He should be fed in a separate area due to not wanting to share his food with people or other animals. He can only have HARD TOY ONLY. This pet has been spayed/neutered, vaccinated (age appropriate), microchipped, and tested for heartworm (age appropriate). They also receive monthly heartworm prevention and flea/tick while they stay with our shelter. If you are interested in seeing this pet please fill out the adoption application on our website. Once approved, you will be contacted to set up an appointment. www.fsac-spca.org Meet Socks a spunky mixed breed. He is a very active fella who enjoys to rip and race during playgroups. He does well with other dogs but is a rough goofy player and needs a playmate that can keep up with him.

            "description": "DOB: 2/2017. Weight: 58 lbs\nThis guy is so full of life! Very playful and full of personality! He is definitely a people dog, he will need some firm and consistent training to be safe to live with other dogs, he prefers to be the dominant dog. He does not respond well to people taking things away from him when eating, drinking, or playing, so a potential home will need to be attentive and proactive to manage this behavior. Previous owners say he is fine with cats. He is crate trained but is not very fond of it. He is mostly house trained and would benefit crating at night to avoid any accidents.\nHe is utd on shots, neutered, microchipped and heartworm tested. He came to the shelter 7/2020.***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS? CONTACT pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com\nOur adoption fee is $150 which covers a portion of the dog's vetting costs. The adoption process includes the completion of an application followed by an interview.\nClick here to submit an adoption application: https://pcpoundpuppies.webs.com/adoption-application\n***IMPORTANT: Due to the effects of COVID-19, our Sunday adoption events at Pet Food Center have been canceled until further notice.

He was found in critical condition after being attacked by other animals, so he is easily scared by loud noises/quick movements and would do best in a quiet home with no small children. P\u00e2t\u00e9 will need a patient adopter who is dedicated to helping him overcome his fears and anxieties. Rest assured, when he is given the time and space to come out of his shell and connect and build trust, he will quickly let his playful and sweet personality shine! \n\nOnce he creates a bond with someone and feels safe, he is a total velcro dog and will even guard you while you're on the toilet. He is most energetic in the mornings and will demand alllllll of the booty rubs upon waking. P\u00e2t\u00e9 is house trained, walks wonderfully on a leash, LOVES napping in small corners of the house after long walks/car rides, and absolutely cannot resist a good swim in the lake. \n\nP\u00e2t\u00e9 also has epilepsy, which is easily managed with anti-seizure medication and blood work every six months for the rest of his life. \n\nWhile he may have scars and trauma, P\u00e2t\u00e9 is fiercely loyal and would be the perfect dog for the right situation. We are confident this gentle boy will thrive with stability and lots of love. Please contact Mazie's Mission today if you think this big bear would be the perfect match for you",

Teenagers are fine. They are very active and love to run, wrestle and play together so a big fenced yard would be ideal. They like to play in water too. They are not good with livestock and no small animals too due to prey drive. They are crate trained. They will probably do best in a home together without other dogs.

Phoenix was adopted as a puppy and lived happily with his family for four years until, through no fault of his own, he was surrendered by his owner because they decided to move into an apartment that does not allow dogs, so Phoenix found himself back at 11th Hour once again. He would love to live in a home with a person or family for him to love again.\n\nPhoenix is a beautiful, loyal, obedient and loving six year-old dog who bonds easily with people. He is good with all adults, housetrained and is fine when crated. He loves to go for car rides, walks in the park, play with toys or a nice game of \"Fetch\". He loves to receive affection and to have his tummy rubbed. He is eager to please and even knows a few commands like \"paw\" and \"sit\". Phoenix does well on pack walks and when around other dogs. He grew up as the only dog in the house but may do well with another dog or dogs after a proper introduction. If you are looking for a loyal, affectionate companion please consider completing an application for him and be sure to ask for Phoenix!\n\nPhoenix is non-reactive to other dogs and may do will with another dog after a proper introduction, good with adults, loves the car, crate-trained, loves to go for walks in the park and for dips in the pond, obedient, loyal, affectionate, eager to please and very intelligent.\n\nAlthough he does well with meeting children, he should not be homed with them as he requires consistent structure in his home. He needs a STRONG leader who is willing to provide and maintain boundaries for him in your house :)",

Her enthusiasm may overwhelm some dogs, but she really does want to play play play!\n\nFamily Visit: Waived\nDog to Dog: Required\n\nChild Integration Score: Moderate\n\n___________\n\nAll adoptions are by appointment only.

Some animals, especially puppies/kittens and small dogs, can go very quickly. For this reason, we recommend that if you see an animal you are interested in, you send in an adoption questionnaire as soon as possible. Please do not bring your current pets to the shelter. If you intend to adopt a dog and want the new dog and your current dog to meet, that can be scheduled with the help of your Adoption Counselor.

Most of your questions will be answered in this biography.\n\n*Housetrained\n*Doing Well on Leash\n*Kid Tested \n*Will be Happiest as an Only Dog\n*Good Option as a Family Dog\n*Crate Trained\n\nHERSCHEL  is a  lovable hunk! \n\nHe\u2019s house trained and walks great on a leash! He\u2019s a pretty low energy dog, but enjoys an evening walk and a roll in the grass. He loves snoozing, snuggles, and kisses! \n\nHerschel is dog selective.  He is also sometimes protective over his resources (food/toys).  We are recommending Herschel as an only dog, and honestly, he would love to be the solo beneficiary of all the snuggles and affection.  He ADORES his humans!  Herschel is great with all people, including children! Herschel will make a great pet for anyone looking to love on this hunk!\n\nWhen Herschel was rescued, we noticed that he had stiffness in his left hind leg/hip.  We wanted to make sure that there wasn't an underlying condition that was creating pain, and took him in for an evaluation.  X-rays disclosed a previous injury that was not properly addressed resulting in chronic osteoarthritis.  In order for Herschel to live a pain-free life, the recommendation was for a surgical procedure known as Femoral Head Ostectomy (FHO) to provide permanent relief.  Herschel is now in post-surgical recovering  and doing well.  His Foster Mom is providing daily physical therapy exercises to make sure the hip remains flexible and at optimum functionality.  Herschel also had laser therapy to expedite the healing.  If you adopt HERSCHEL before completion of his 12-weeks of in home physical therapy, we will show you how to perform these easy exercises which will also help in your bonding process with your new companion.\n\nHerschel, although a young guy,  was in need of a dental cleaning (should be done regularly for all adult dogs to maintain health), and he received that service too! All in all, he  is feeling so much better now!  Just look at his happy photos.\n\nWe believe HERSCHEL to be an American Staffordshire mix. His estimated DOB is 04/08/2016, and he weighs 745.6 pounds as of 7/16/20.\n\nFor more information on our adoption process, please visit our website at www.youluckydogrescue.org and read our Adoption FAQ's and Before You Adopt documents. You can complete an online adoption application from our website. You can also email info@youluckydogrescue.org for additional details that are not included in this biography.\n\nPRIVATE MEET & GREETS: Submitting an adoption application is required before a private meet & greet will be scheduled. We will complete a pre-screening first to make sure that the dog you are interested in is a good fit for you. That way, we don't unnecessarily waste your time or the foster's time. \n\nOur adoption fee is $300 and includes all age appropriate vaccines, spay or neuter and microchipping. All of our rescue dogs are heart worm tested annually beginning at 9 months of age, and they are kept on monthly heart worm and flea preventatives.\n\nThe breed and age included in this listing is based upon the opinion of a vet that has examined the dog. We cannot confirm the age of the dog unless the dog was born in the care of the rescue. \n\nWe are located in the metro Atlanta area. We currently do not allow out of state adoptions as a home check is required as part of the adoption process.\n\nwww.youluckydogrescue.org - Adoption Application can be found at this website.",

Some animals, especially puppies/kittens and small dogs, can go very quickly. For this reason, we recommend that if you see an animal you are interested in, you send in an adoption questionnaire as soon as possible. Please do not bring your current pets to the shelter. If you intend to adopt a dog and want the new dog and your current dog to meet, that can be scheduled with the help of your Adoption Counselor.

            "description": "Hello everyone my name is Chato and I was surrendered by my family due to work changes that caused them not to have time for me. I am approx 5 years old and am an Olde English Bulldogge. I have lots of energy and love chew toys. I can get things I am not supposed to have and chew them up. Just fyi. I am completely housebroken but have never been in a crate. I get along with my fur siblings. I am in great physical shape and love my people. I need exercise during the day because I have lots of energy. I need to learn basic commands but I am very smart and should learn quickly. I don\u2019t fight about food or toys. I would do best in a home with a male dog.\n\nIf you are interested in Chato, please visit our website: www.ilenglishbulldogrescue.org, and read through our adoption criteria to see if you meet our requirements. If you do, please fill out an application to adopt.\n\nChato's adoption fee is: $350.00\n\nVisit us on Facebook: Visit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IllinoisEnglishBulldogRescue",

They were originally found together as stray puppies and adopted together. Skywalker does have some anxiety when alone and he is very sensitive to changes and new surroundings . He was very very skinny coming from his last home and did not eat for several days. He is finally at a pretty good weight but still needing a few more pounds. They came from a home where there were young children that tormented them. So definitely no young children. Teenagers are fine. They are very active and love to run, wrestle and play together so a big fenced yard would be ideal. They like to play in water too. They are not good with livestock and no small animals too due to prey drive. They are crate trained. They will probably do best in a home together without other dogs.

I am very active and love people so I think I need a family who will enjoy exercising with me every day. I walk really well on a leash and love to explore new places. I love to play with the dogs in my foster home. We have a big ball that I like to chase and lots of toys to keep me busy. We also have a pond and I love to go swimming. I used to sleep in a crate, but I really like the couch much better so my foster mom moved the crate to the garage and I don't have to sleep in it anymore. I am working on staying down, but I really love to give hugs and I get so excited to see people I just can't help it. My foster mom tells me I'm not a human, but I think maybe I should've been. I learned to sit and I love treats. I usually come when called but I am independent and I might miss something! My foster parents say I'm special because I give the people I love a kiss just so they know I love them! I will come to you neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccinations, and up to date on flea/tick preventatives. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved, you must also pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Children in my home need to be at least 8 years old as I could knock little ones down with my playfulness. And I am pretty agile so I require a 6 ft fence. I can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. My rescue is able to transport me to those states. If you would like to give me a furever home, please fill out an application on my rescue's website. \n\nBeing fostered in Ruthven, IA",

Red loves all people even kids (older kids he can't knock over with all his goofy energy)! He used to be nervous with men, but he has been doing much better with it in his current foster home. He just needs a minute to sniff you out and with treats and belly rubs, he will warm right up and slobber you with kisses.\n\nRed likes long walks at the park and car rides. He also enjoys having a wide assortment of bones and toys to keep himself entertained.\nHe also\nloves to snuggle with his people and likes having his own blanket to nest within. He loves sleeping in! Honestly, who doesn't?\n\nRed needs a family who is attentive to his diet. He is on a chicken free/grain free diet due to allergies. He has also experienced several rashes caused from environmental allergens, which are now under control by the prescription Apoquel and over the counter Zyrtec which are taken daily. Red also uses Douxo shampoo as needed only.\n\nRed must have another dog companion in his furever home. He is absolutely thriving in his foster home where he has 2 other dogs to hang out with!\n\nAnother good thing about Red is that he attended board and train for three weeks, where he brushed up on leash etiquette and learned the commands sit, place, break, come, heel, and stay. Red is housebroken and will notify when he needs to go outside. He is crate trained during the day when no one is home. He LOVES to sleep in bed with his people at night.\n\nPlease fill out an application to make this handsome boy yours!\n\n**We do not adopt to Canada due to breed specific legislation and border restrictions**Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

I'm asenior lab mix and I'm ready to join your family!I'll make the perfect companion because my foster family says I'm super relaxed and low maintenance. I like to follow them around and I'm happy to nap while you work or watch TV. In my time at my foster home the TLC they have given me has made my coat so shiny and soft - perfect for petting! So carve out a lab sized spot on your couch and invite me to move in - I'm totally ready for it. \n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee. The deposit is refundable upon completion of the spay / neuter surgery.\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\nPlease visit our facebook for more information about adoption specials, and adoption events.

Loyal & Protective: When I see other dogs or strangers come by my foster home I bark to let everyone know. Loving: although I'm notreally one to cuddle, I do enjoy sharing the couch with you. I will request for pets and scratches by using my snout on your hand. I enjoy playing with toys and unlike a puppy, I treat my things very nicely! Since food excites me, I might try to sneak a bite here or there :) I'm a medium boy with medium energy, happy to relax, but when the leash comes out I do a little dance. I also like looking out the window to see what's happening out there. I share my foster home with a resident beagle and we coexist pretty well together. I walk well on a leash, know the command for sit, and tolerate my crate okay (though I can be trusted to be left uncrated because I'm a full grown doggo!). I hope we can meet soon so I can show you my little happy dog dance: I wiggle my butt and pitter patter my little paws.\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee.

Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative.

Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative.

Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com. To fill out an application, please visit\n\nhttp://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption\n.",

She is crate trained, housebroken, and loves toys. Lexi has never been on a leash before and is awful. She completely freaks out. We are recommending a fenced in yard for her. She is wonderful with all people but we are recommending no small kids. We believe Lexi may have had to scrounge for food. She sometimes will grab your fingers when being given treats. Lexi is not being mean, we think it's the way she was treated. She takes food and runs. We don't want any little ones getting their fingers nibbled. Lexi is pretty good with other dogs but can sometimes be a jerk. A one dog household would be best. She is very playful and acts a lot younger than 10.",

            "description": "Shenzi is about 3 years old and 11 to 12 lbs. Handsome black & tan boy who is a bit shy - he is coming around with attention, good food, and friendship. He gets along great with the other small dogs in his area and plays with the puppies.\nHis group came from Central Cal - rescued from orchards where they were living. We have a socialization program that has really helped them to heal.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

            "description": "This girl is the best dog. Just about perfect. Is there room for this pretty girl in your life? Carolina is looking for that special someone!\n\nShe and her brother Sonny have come a LONG way. She's gone from hating attention to almost craving it and walks incredibly well on a leash (versus biting/freezing). She is very treat motivated and was easy to teach to sit and several other commands.\n\nShe does good with dogs, especially low energy dogs as she won't fetch or wrestle. And while she'll willingly jump on your lap for pets, she really isn't a cuddler or will lay down on your lap. She's independent that way and doesn't need to be crated either.\n\nShe needs to keep moving forward and deserves a home!\n\nNew to the story of Sonny & Carolina... here's a video from North Texas Giving Day:\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/358414206\n\nCarolina is a beautiful red pit mix, dainty in size. Over the last 6 months she has made huge strides in her confidence and willingness to forget her past. She has become so social and will even jump on the bed for pets. She is dog friendly and loves to be in your lap for car rides. She would make a great family pet, just needs some time to warm up and get used to her new surroundings. She is healthy, sweet, weighs about 30 pounds and is 3 years old.\n\nCarolina was found with her brother and based on their demeanor when we found them it is assumed they had little human interaction. Over the past 6 months, they have opened up and their trust has increased. \n\nSo Sonny, the poor pup shivering in the shelter afraid of anything that comes near him, has a sister... meet Carolina. Like her brother, she is equally as shy, so hopefully together they can build some confidence! We look forward to seeing the change in these two now that they are in a loving foster home.\n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. For more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process. Thank you for your interest in adopting a Dallas DogRRR.",

She appears to have the personality traits of a Dalmation, with looks similar to a Hound or sight dog. She is energetic, LOVES her toys, and will need training for her bark. Rainy will need an active owner who runs or walks multiple times per day and has lots of time and energy for training and playtime. \nWhile she hasn't quite figured out how to calm down in order to snuggle, she enjoys companionship and play sessions. Oh, and did we mention that she loves to give kisses? \n\nThis is a dog who would not be well suited for an apartment because of her loud bark. Rainy is a young puppy with a lot of love to give who will need the typical puppy training all young dogs get. She is well behaved around cats.\n\n\nIf you are interested in Rainy, apply today at www.animalcaresociety.org! \\\\\\ Rainy IS SPONSORED BY OUR FRIENDS AT OLDFATHER LAW FIRM THRU February 2021!

In his declining years, he did the best he could to care for his dogs but due to age and health related issues, Reese and her sister did not receive the socialization that they needed to be truly well-rounded dogs. \n\nAs such, Reese does not know what it means to actually live in a home environment and is learning things like how to walk on a leash, and how to be approached by people regularly. Reese needs a home with a confident dog who she can take her cues from and learn how to be part of a family with. She also needs a secure fence. \n\n\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

What we do know is that Paco was surrendered to Macon-Bibb Animal Welfare by his previous owners and was rather underweight at the time. Paco is a good boy that has clearly lost his home and routine and everything he knew, and is scared and rather heartbroken. Paco would do best in a home with older children, like teenagers, if any at all. Paco knows how to walk on a leash is okay being crated. Paco needs a family that loves and dotes on him and can show him that life isn\u2019t going to be hard on him any longer, and that he can be confident once again.\n\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

Can test upon request.\nGood with Kids: Yes, although older preferred due to his need to continue growing in confidence. Please see below.\n\n\nKipper is a sweet, scared little boy that came to us after being taken into custody via local law enforcement due to severe neglect from his previous \u201cowner.\u201d Precious Kipper has learned so much from us while in his time with us, and continues to grow every day. He is now able to walk on a leash although he is still learning leash manners with it (he had never seen one before), he knows the schedule of the rescue and thrives on it, he knows that we talk to him and greet him. \n\nKipper is still learning how to be confident and has quite a long way to go in that sense. He must have another dog in his home and a secure fence to help him learn what it is to live in a home environment- something he\u2019s never had the chance at before. He LOVES being around other dogs and really opens up with them nearby! \n\nKipper is very fearful of new experiences and will try to run from them or shrink in fear- but with a buddy at his side (he has several at the rescue he follows and takes cues from). We are on the hunt for a family that can appreciate the timid warrior soul that he has and guide him to the strong, confident boy we know he will be. \n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA.

            "description": "Meet Piper\nRescued and safe\u2026 Calling all senior dog lovers! Piper needs you. We rescued Piper (and her friend, Bear) from Cobb County Animal Control when their owner wasn\u2019t able to care for them due to health reasons. Bear being younger had rescue, but Piper was in danger of being euthanized. Bear and Piper have lived together for a while, including in foster care most recently, before they came to our shelter. When their futures became uncertain we wanted to make sure they were able to stay together and find soft places to land. They arrived at our shelter on July 26, 2020.  Bear has since been adopted.\nPiper is a beautiful purebred German shepherd. She\u2019s a senior girl at 10 years old. She is blind. Piper gets around very well though and relies on voices or presence to know where her person is or doggie friend is. Piper was in danger of being euthanized. In our opinion no dog deserves to die just because she\u2019s old and blind. That\u2019s when they need us the most! Her personality is terrific. She\u2019s easy-going, just a love of a dog. She\u2019s in good health, but does need daily enzyme powder on her food to ensure that she\u2019s able to process it, but it\u2019s easy to manage. \nShe\u2019s very calm and gentle. She walks well on a leash and she rides well in a car. She has beautiful manners. She enjoys sunning herself in the yard and quietly taking in the sounds around her. Piper longs to live in a quiet, calm place where she can feel safe. The unknown and unexpected noises of the shelter are tough on her, but she bravely deals with her new circumstances.  She loves sleeping and she eats well. She likes her walks in the forest and will gingerly and slowly feel her way forward. Piper gets along well with Bear and it would be great if these two could be adopted together, but it\u2019s not necessary. Piper seems to like calm male dogs versus females and cats don\u2019t seem to be an issue. \nPiper is a remarkable girl, who\u2019s had a tough go in life. Our greatest hope is to find this girl a place where she can live out the rest of her days in gentle kindness and quiet. If she can go with her bestie, Bear, so much the better. He helps to guide her and she knows when he is around. If you\u2019re able to open your heart and home to Piper please get your application in. This exceptional dog deserves a chance at a loving home. \nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.  If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy., Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.\n\nFollow us on Facebook\nTo stay informed on this animal as well as our new arrivals, adoptions and events follow us on Facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/smithgallhumanesociety.",

            "description": "In late April we ran across a post of a dog that had been kicked out of her house and out of her yard to her neighbors yard. She sat there, staring at the property that she had once called home. The post said\n\n\"Her owners ran her off their property and she is currently at their neighbor's place. They have bred her over and over for her pitiful puppies and now that she MAY have got pregnant by another stray dog they threw her OUT!!! She keeps looking over to the property where she used to live at. She's very hot, sad, confused and helpless.\"\n\nWe sprung into action and found a foster and immediately got her out of there. After her 1st vet visit it became clear the dire health situation which she was in. She was HW positive and had a tick disease, in addition to in fact being pregnant. We had to make a decision, did we spay, and risk that she very well may bleed out, or do we allow her to deliver and understand she could also bleed out that way. After speaking with numerous vets we made the decision to allow her to whelp her pups as the risk there seemed less than opening her up. She gave birth to 8 pups, one wasn't properly formed and one died a couple days later. Unfortunately over the first 24 hours Lark began to have life threatening issues. She was hospitalized, recieved fluids and a bevy of meds in addition to a blood transfusion. Over the next week we all held our breath praying that her red blood count would stabilize and that she would begin to eat on her own. Eventually she did and we were elated when she could eventually leave to head back to her fosters home. Unfortunately this meant that she could not only not nurse her pups, she couldn't even hear them. The foster wanted to keep the pups and momma under the same roof anyway and she was devoted to bottle feeding and socializing the pups. Lark recovered and her pups are now ready to find homes of their own, as is Lark. \n \n\nLark is dog friendly, she lived with other dogs in her original home and her first foster had multiple other dogs which she had no issues with. However since the first foster the next 2 fosters she wasn't impressed with their dogs. Not sure if it was the way she was introduced or if she just has decided she would rather not deal with other dogs haha. I truly believe that she would be ok depending on the individual dog. \n\nLark is on slow kill Heartworm treatment as that is the only treatment that is safe for her at this time. We will test her again in 6 months and see where she is at, then go from there. \n\nLark has had a horrid start to life. She was devoted and loved people who obviously aren't fit to own a rock. Further her ears were butchered, she wasn't even slightly cared for and she has had litter after litter. Her life has changed now however and she knows it! She knows that she's now an inside family member, cherished and loved. She is feeling better and has the sweetest personality. This little lady deserves the most amazing home and we are absolutely devoted to finding it for her! \n\nIf you think it's you, please contact us ASAP!",

She is a super smart and food-motivated girl who is ready to keep learning!\n\nAnna needs a home without cats or small dogs, but may do well with larger dogs with a proper introduction.\n\nAnna is very playful and would love a fenced in yard to run around in. She's a goofy girl whose favorite activities include chewing on bones, chasing tennis balls, and guarding the yard from squirrels. She does great in the car and would love to be your co-pilot.\n\nUltimately, Anna loves affection and more than anything wants to be close for cuddles, pets, and naps. She can't wait to meet you!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Anna, please fill out an application at: https://www.dogsaredeservingrescue.com/adoptable-dogs/adoption-application/",

She warms up and becomes a complete love bug.  She likes walks and is very playful.  Molly will need a very special adopter.  Someone who is home all day and can be very gentle, patient and extremely loving. She is an excellent escape artist so a very secure wooden fence is a must.  Molly gets along well with other dogs but children are not a good idea.  Due to digestive issues Molly will need to be on special prescription food.",

He now walks on leash very well and will even pass by strangers on walks, he will still try to avoid larger groups of people, but I\u2019m hopeful this will improve as well. He is also cat friendly and has learned to not chase the resident cat any longer, instead he will sometimes just follow her around nicely. If Alex is moved into a home with cats it may take a few days to get him acclimated and his adopter will need to be prepared to work on that with him. He\u2019s still playful with other dogs and doesn\u2019t have a preference for any size. He loves playing catch, but is still learning the concept of \u201cfetch\u201d. He has not been around any children at all so we can\u2019t be sure if he will do well with them, so it\u2019s best that the children in the home be at least 10 years old and be able to understand that he may need some space at first.\n\nSince Alex loves to play so much the dog in his home has to be just as playful as he is, he does not require a yard but it would be amazing if he did find a home that has a secure yard that he can run and play in.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.  ONCE YOU HAVE DONE SO, PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING:\n1.       Visit www.dogswithoutborders.org\n2.      Then fill out an online ADOPTION APPLICATION -  http://dogswithoutborders.org/adopt-a-dog/adoption-application/\n3.       Please wait to hear from our representative in approximately 48 hours on weekdays.\n4.

            "description": "Breed:  Formosan Mountain Dog mix\nAge:  1 yr.\nWeight:  30 lbs.\nGood with dogs:  yes, no large dogs\nGood with cats:  yes\nGood with kids:  10 yrs. and older\nEnergy level:  medium\nGood with men/strangers:  fearful, prefers women\nHypoallergenic:  no\n\nSpecial home requirements or medical:  needs a playful dog; yard preferred\n\nAdditional info:\n\nAlex has really started to open up and is gaining more confidence. He now walks on leash very well and will even pass by strangers on walks, he will still try to avoid larger groups of people, but I\u2019m hopeful this will improve as well. He is also cat friendly and has learned to not chase the resident cat any longer, instead he will sometimes just follow her around nicely. If Alex is moved into a home with cats it may take a few days to get him acclimated and his adopter will need to be prepared to work on that with him. He\u2019s still playful with other dogs and doesn\u2019t have a preference for any size. He loves playing catch, but is still learning the concept of \u201cfetch\u201d. He has not been around any children at all so we can\u2019t be sure if he will do well with them, so it\u2019s best that the children in the home be at least 10 years old and be able to understand that he may need some space at first.\n\nSince Alex loves to play so much the dog in his home has to be just as playful as he is, he does not require a yard but it would be amazing if he did find a home that has a secure yard that he can run and play in.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.

She has boundless energy and enjoys playing outside with her foster doggie siblings. When she first moved in, she lunged and barked at everyone in the house because she was afraid. After several weeks, she warmed up to her foster mother and now comes for kisses and snuggles. Be aware that she is likely to bark and lunge at strangers and would probably benefit from some behavioral training. She is looking for a patient, loving home with no children and low traffic that will provide plenty of snuggles and exercise while helping her build confidence. A fenced yard would be a bonus, as she can be temperamental on a leash. Adoption fee is $300.\n\nAll UnderDogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm checked, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick preventatives.  For consideration for one or more dogs, we require that an on-line application is filled out.  \n\nTO ADOPT THIS DOG PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AT https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/. \n\nSorry, we do not adopt outside of Florida.  Applicants are subject to a home visit, and veterinary references will be checked. Please include a vet reference (including phone number) when applying online.\n\nOur application process:\nFIRST, an application must be approved for adoption from our rescue.\nSECOND, we determine whether the dog that has been applied for is a \"good match\" for the household that wants to adopt him/her.  We take into consideration the dog's activity level, compatibility with other members of the household (human and other pets), etc.\nIf your application has been approved, but the dog you applied for is no longer available, please take the time and look over our adoptable dogs again.  We will make every effort to find the right dog for an approved applicant.\n\nWe hope you agree and understand that our goal to find the best forever home is our #1 priority!

His new owner should be prepared for some high energy! He is currently recovering from flea dermatitis and his hair is slowly growing back. His new home should have a securely fenced yard and be willing to work with him on basic manners. \n\nIf you wish to be considered for this animal, please download an application at http://fallstonanimalrescue.org/adopt/ or email fallstonrescue@aol.com to request one. It can take up to 2 weeks to process an application; we suggest following up by email on the status if you have not received a reply within 3-5 days. We are an all-volunteer based rescue and we ask for your patience if we are slow to respond. \n\nPlease understand that we fit the dog with the home we feel is best suited and will accept multiple applications for one dog. We have strict requirements for families with children under 10 since many of our dogs are grumpy and may not do well with children. Some dogs will have fence requirements, while others may not. It is preferred you are within a 2 hour drive from our Rescue Center in Fallston, MD.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment and it is our duty to do our very best to place them correctly the first time around. We do not take the adoption process lightly. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!\n\n",

I am a lab mix about 2 years old, weigh about 45 pounds, I love kids.\n\nMy wonderful rescue helped me when i was a stray and Mrs. Joyce became my foster. Mrs. Joyce is a dog trainer so that was a big bonus for me. I have been at her house for 6 months and I have made a lot of friends there, animal and human.\n\nSome of the things I like to do are: play with balls, stuffed animals and play under the water sprinkler. Since I am smart I learn commands quickly especially if treats are available. For instance, I can sit, come when called and do puppy push ups. I really would be a great running partner, I love to run.\n\nWhen I am out in public I love meeting people and am always friendly. I can meet and greet really good. However sometimes I forget and jump up on people and my foster reminds me this is a no,no. I can be a calm girl when my foster family watches t.v. I will even sit with them nicely. My favorite thing to do is play with the dogs. Our favorite sport is to run up and down the fence when the kids come by on their bikes. I also love to go walking and say hello to other dogs and people. I do like my bed and treats. I am house trained and definitely do not chew items up. Mrs Joyce has rabbits and I am good with them too. They are cute!\n\nI would be best as an only dog as I play rough and have waited so long for my own home that I want all the attention and lovings.\n\nOver all I am healthy and looking forward to my own home and family. Being a dog trainer, Mrs. Joyce has taught me to have good manners and since I am smart I can remember manners really good!Interested in adopting a companion dog or cat from Texas Animal Society?\nPlease email info@texasanimalsociety.com and complete online adoption application at texasanimalsociety.org\nCome visit our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/www.texasanimalsociety.org/",

He rarely pulls and if you even jog a little he stays right beside you. Daily walks you and Goose would take together would be an easy way to stay on track!\n\n \n\nOn the flip side; Goose is at that perfect age where lounging around is a great activity. If lots of activity isn't the kind of dog you are looking for Goose is a great fit. Hes an easy going boy!! He knows SIT, PAW and learning DOWN. He is a pretty quick learner and happy to please his people! Goose is food motivated so learning new tricks would likely be fairly easy.\n\nHe'd be happy to travel in the car with you as well. He has riden with many of our volunteers and is a great co-pilot. He won't \"bark\" directions or corrections while you drive :)!\n\nEven though he will play a bit of tug-o-war or fetch a ball with you; he'd be just as happy relaxing next to you; high energy he is NOT! He is a 5-yr old GENTLEman; 60lb male Boxer mix. He loves everyone he meets and is a quick to give you a little kiss! He has been good with older children and very polite with excellent manners. Goose does need to be the only dog.\n\nAs part of Goose's $250 adoption fee, he is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and current on his monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. If you have questions about this sweet boy, email Dogteam@pawsforlifenc.org. If you wish to adopt Goose, you can fill in an online application for him under the Adopt a Pet Tab on our website: www.pawsforlifenc.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nPlease review our Adoption Process before filling out an application. If you would like to try a Foster to Adopt trial, please fill out an Adoption Application.\n\nIf you are only interested in temporarily Fostering one of our rescues, please fill out a Foster Application.\n\nLola is an adorable small GSD mix who was rescued in September 2019 from the streets of Tijuana, while tied to a post. Lola was fearful when she first arrived in a dog kennel for transport and was very scared. She didn't hesitate to try to bite, so we did what we always do when we have a dog who is scared and can be a fear biter. We gave her space and she came out on her own to explore, and after a few minutes slowly adjusted and trusted a couple of selected volunteers. Lola was fostered in Mexico with her original rescuer for a long time until she was able to find a foster family who took her in on a foster-to-adopt trial. They knew this girl would need dog training because of her uncertainty with some people and dogs. The couple that took her were first time dog owners in a condo setting, who would need to walk her daily. They did sign her up to dog training classes, but as time progressed Lola became protective of them and they were not the right family for her. They were not able to control her on leash walks or when people would come to their home to visit. As a result, they only fostered her for 4-6 weeks. It has been about 6 months since that foster experience and for the past 4-6 months, she has been fostered in a home with a yard, one handler/foster, and several other cats and dogs. We can say this about Lola:1) Ideally she needs an experienced dog owner, who understands how to be the leader of the pack. Lola is a pretty great, easy dog, but NOT if she senses no leadership. 2) She is a young, healthy, and up-to-date on medical. She is almost 2 years of age and about 40 pounds.3) She is crate trained, house trained, and rides well in the car. 4) DOG interaction: Lola does well with all puppies and all male dogs. She does well with female dogs, BUT if they are females like her with a potential dominant/alpha personality, there could be issues. In that case it may be a rough or slow introduction, instead of a \"let's all be friends and play\" type of interaction. It could be more of a 'I will ignore you, but if you start something with me, I will also continue something.\" In that case, there will be just a few dogs that she will not get along with, but for the most part she does very well with most dogs. If Lola is being naughty or planning on starting to be naughty, her handler/foster/owner will need to be observant during introductions so they can quickly stop things from escalating by verbally correcting her. When she is corrected and told to stop, she will immediately listen and will go do something else. This will only be for the first few hours of meeting another dog with a strong personality. After a day or two of being around that type of dog, she will ignore/forget the personality differences they had with each other. HOWEVER, when it comes to recourses like toys/treats, she can share when she is in the mood. But she will sometimes refuse to share with any dog personality/age/breed when it comes to toys/treats, so she needs to be supervised and corrected before anything gets started. 5) Lola loves cats and cats seem to love her! We mean INDOOR CATS, because she can have \"prey drive\" with birds, squirrels and cats in the yard. This is not severe, but she can chase them, which can turn into something else. A home with indoor/outdoor cats would NOT be well matched for this girl. Lola has many indoor feline friends from ARWOB, from kittens to senior cats. If the cats ignore her she ignores them, if the kittens try to play with her she loves it. 6) Lola is not a big barker and stays home alone very well, although it's best if she is not aware that you have left the house, so her not hearing the car coming and going would be best. On a vocalization level, we would put Lola at 3 (with 10 being the highest). She can whine when left home alone, if she sees you leaving her. But if she is in her crate in the bedroom when you leave or in the yard for a short period of time, she could care less and does just fine. She is not a barker when in the yard or inside the home, UNLESS someone she is not \"feeling\" approaches. Sometimes people will walk their dogs near the front yard and she could care less about them. Sometimes the UPS driver will make a delivery and she will ignore this. But other times she will BARK and protect her property like any other BIG dog (i.e. German Shepherd protection). She can be easily corrected if you are there to call her back, but this could mean she could be a liability if left unsupervised in an area where different people come and go. Some people trigger her instinct to \"protect her home.\"7) Lola does well on leash walks for the most part, with minimal pulling and dog reactivity. But on occasion, she will sometimes get on high alert and start pulling more than usual. She is easily corrected when she starts pulling and/or barking. This is where a knowledgeable adopter comes in and as long as they take the leader role and correct her when this happens, it can be corrected quickly. Her handler will need to be aware of their surroundings when taking her on walks to make sure nothing is out of control, so she can be immediately corrected.8) Lola does not live with children now, but she did live with kids when she was in Baja, Mexico. She does see kids and has no problem with them. 9) Lola is an excellent exercise partner and a napping partner. She can do both like a pro! 10) An adopter for Lola will need to ENROLL her in dog training with a behaviorist for evaluation on DAY ONE before taking her home. They will need to make sure she does not revert to her old behavior from when she lived with her foster family in Mexico (i.e. over protective and spoiled). Behaviorists stress the importance of DAY ONE evaluation to get the family started on the right path. If an adopter has a behaviorist/trainer that they have worked with or have experience, that is great. However, we must stress that this needs to be BEHAVIOR training, not just general training commands like sit/stay/down. We are in no rush to move Lola since she is EASY PEASY for her current foster mom and does not demand anything, nor get into trouble in her foster home. Her foster mom finds she is an easy partner to have at home.11) We are ideally looking for a foster-to-adopt trial for Lola of approximately 2-4weeks, before we finalize her adoption. We are happy to lend a crate, leash, etc. to get her started, but we will not cover the fees for dog training during the foster-to-adopt trial. The only thing we could approve is a weekend stay with Lola, so her potential adopter can get to know her a bit. Then the potential adopter would be able to decide if the foster-to-adopt trial would be feasible and if paying for training services is something they are willing to do. You can email us at animalrescuers@sbcglobal.net with any additional questions about Lola. Thanks!If you think Lola would be a good match for you and you would like to foster her or possibly adopt her, please submit an application online. Don't wait!If you would like to meet one of our animals, PLEASE fill out an adoption application.\n\nDog Adoption Application\n\nCat Adoption Application\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nIF YOU ARE IN THE MILITARY\nplease fill out a short questionnaire in addition to the adoption application.\n\nMilitary Questionnaire",

Ramsey, is a 3 year old boxer pitty mix and happiest on an adventure (water included is a plus) and with women. She has perfect leash manners, sensitive to commands, and aims to please. Ramsey, is still learning how to be a dog in our big scary world so patience and dedication are the key ingredients. New places, people, and noises can leave her unsure but she will look to her handler for leadership. Ramsey, likes slow intros with dogs and men, these two categories should not be forced and she needs a strong advocate to keep everyone comfortable and safe. She will be the first one to jump in the car for a road trip or bound happily next to your bike, but she does require proper cool down like all squish faces. Ramsey enjoys affection but is also fine to rest alone.\n\u2022\nIf you would like to schedule a chance to meet Ramsey please fill out our adoption application on our website at www.californiabullyrescue.org/adopt",

He is a friendly dog that needs an experienced owner to train and socialize him.  He is food aggressive with other animals so he is being fed in his crate.  He appears to be house-broken and sleeps in his crate overnight.  He gets along with cats and dogs big and small except when there is food around.  He is about 40-45lbs, slightly chubby at the moment, and would make a good hiking companion.  He is available through Animal Alliance, and they would like a home with no children under 12.

Please take a moment to read the pet\u2019s ENTIRE description which should answer many of your questions.\n\nRhett Butler, very handsome, 18 month old, 65# Redbone Coonhound.  Gets along great with other dogs; plays too rough for cats.  He has a hound bay, so not an apt/condo/duplex dog.  A very sweet boy who likes to play but enjoys snuggling too.  Rhett has a cataract in one eye that dimishes his sight.  His other eye is fine.  He is on daily eye drops for life - $15-$20 a month.  Too exuberant for children under 8.  A secure 4\"+ fenced yard is preferred.  Application available at www.capp-petplacement.org. Approved applicants can meet Rhett by appointment.  Contact - 518-292-0555.\n\nSome of our general policies:  1) Pets can be seen at pet adoption clinics or BY APPOINTMENT TO APPROVED APPLICANTS ONLY.  Application and general adoption fee schedule (exceptions noted in pet's description) at www.capp-petplacement.org .  For our weekly pet adoption clinic schedule, like us on Facebook.  2) For the safety of the dog and children, we generally DO NOT place senior dogs or dogs under 35 pounds in households where children under 8 years old either reside or visit frequently.  3) Note that, unless we have prior records on a rescued pet, ages, grown weight for puppies, etc. are estimates only.  4) If you are interested in a CAPP pet, read CAPP's Program page on our web site which fully explains our adoption process or talk to us at a pet adoption clinic.",

Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nThis dog is heartworm positive but please do not rule him/her out because of it. There's a treatment that is not as hard on the dog as the one you may have heard of and it's FREE.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

He was rescued from Kendall county animal shelter, where he was in danger of being euthanized. Big Daddy is a sweet pup and loves to be around humans and welcomes the company of bigger dogs. Aggression is not in Big Daddies nature; instead, he enjoys the love of humans and will return that love by giving kisses when he has the opportunity.  Big Daddy roams around the property, looking for new and exciting smells. He loves to sleep on the porch waiting for the workers to come to spend time with him. Big Daddy has the most infectious smile that will brighten anyone's day. Remington's Paw Rescue could not be more excited to help this loving pup find a forever home.   ?",

            "description": "*Meet n' greets for this pup, will be taking place on Saturday, 12/5. Please consider this before applying, as we will not be able to accommodate personal scheduling requests.* \n\nObi-Wan Kenobi (DOB: 4/10/20) is a handsome, Husky mix that was surrendered to the rescue when his family could no longer care for him. At the time of his surrender, it was clear that Obi-Wan lacked structure, boundaries, and limits in his previous home. However, since coming into the rescue, all of that has changed. Obi-Wan's foster has established herself as the pack leader and has created an environment in which he is thriving. \n\nCharacteristic of his breed description, Obi-Wan is energetic and alert. He enjoys romping around in the yard and tossing around his toys. Obi-Wan has been well-socialized with other dogs and would benefit from continued training. Obi-Wan would do best in an active adult-only home with working dog experience. \n\nIn order to be considered as a potential adopter, we will need you to complete our online application at www.arrus.org. Should we choose to move forward with your family, you will be notified via email within the week. Due to the large volume of applications received, we are no longer able to respond to each and every applicant. We apologize in advance for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding. \n\nAdditional information and/or medical records for this rescue pet are available and will be reviewed in person should we choose to move forward in scheduling a meet n\u2019 greet. In the meantime, please feel free to follow us on follow us on Instagram (animal_rescue_r_us) and visit our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/arrusadopt for more pictures and posts from his/her foster family. \n\nHELP US, HELP THEM! Animal Rescue R Us is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. We do not receive county, state or federal funding and rely solely on donations. These donations help offset the cost of routine veterinary care, medical expenses, and other necessities while the rescue animal is in our  care. To make a secure donation, please visit www.arrus.org/donate . Alternatively, you may visit our Amazon Wishlist (http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/C36VRV500R85) for a current list of needed supplies!

They believe the leg injury is nerve related as the Xrays did not show anything out of the norm.  She is just the sweetest thing.  She wants to be held all the time!  Last night when my 19 month old grandson walked into the kitchen her tail started really wagging!  There was a gate between them so she was safe but she was really excited when she saw him so I think shes been around kids.\n",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter. We look forward to seeing you soon!\n\nLink to the Adoption Application: \nhttps://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAnimal House Shelter\n13005 Ernesti Road\nHuntley, IL 60142\n\n847-961-5541 phone\n847-961-5537 fax\n\nOpen:\n\nSunday-Friday from 11 AM to 7 PM\nSaturday from 9 AM to 7 PM\n\nConnect With Us:\n\nLike Us On Facebook\u00a0!\nWatch Us On YouTube\u00a0!\nFollow Us On Twitter\u00a0!\n\nAdoption Application:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAdopt a Pet:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/\n\nDirections to Shelter:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/visit/\n\nAdoptable Dogs:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/dogs/\n\nAdoptable Cats:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/cats/\n",

Then it's all hooman interaction time. You got toys? He loves his stuffed iguana or purple stuffed elephant. You got treats? He adores peanut butter flavored ones!! He gets nervous in a car ride and needs help getting in the vehicle, but once on the road, he will be your co-pilot with eagerness. Tango would love to have all of your attention to himself, but if he must share, he does best with female dogs smaller than him, after of course proper introductions are made. Kids, especially young kids, are probably not the best match for him. His new family will need to be wanting to keep him active and moving so will need a yard with a fence. He will be your perfect security guard and let you know when strangers are near. Proper introductions to guests are a must until he gets to know them and will then smother them with kisses. He is crate (although does better outside of one) trained, leash trained, and potty trained. He is even muzzle trained if you need an escort in Lowe's!!",

            "description": "Hi I'm Charlie! I am a high energy dog that loves to play. Children and new dogs are my absolute favorite. The best part about my foster home is that we have guests over often and I think they are all coming to see me! I really enjoy laying on the couch with my foster family and love touching them with my paw or laying my head on their laps. I love my crate and know how to potty outside. I take my squirrel hunting very seriously but I've never been quick enough to catch one! I'd love a home with a big yard to run around in and a family who will embrace my sweet nature.\n\nAll of our pets start their journey in Memphis Tennessee where they remain in loving foster families until they are adopted.\n\nIn order to qualify for ALIVE Rescue Memphis's program all of the following steps must be met:\n\n\u2022 You must be at least 21 years of age and be able to provide ALIVE with proof of age.\n\n\u2022 Any current pets must be up to date on vaccinations, and be spayed/neutered. Exceptions to this will only be considered if proof of a medical explanation is provided.\n\n\u2022 If you currently rent, you must provide a landlord\u2019s phone number and a copy of your executed lease.\n\n\u2022 All members of the family living in the home where the animal will be placed must be interviewed.\n\n\u2022 Applicant must live within 50 miles of Memphis if interested in adopting and within 30 miles of Memphis if interested in fostering. \n\n\u2022Allow an ALIVE Rescue Memphis representative into your home for a visit to insure that your home is safe for the potential new dog or cat.\n\n\u2022You must allow an ALIVE Rescue Memphis representative into your home for a visit to ensure that your home is safe for the potential new pet.\n\n\u2022You must be able and willing to spend the time and money necessary to provide training, medical treatment, and proper care for a pet.\n\n\u2022Currently, adoptions fees in Memphis are $275 for a dog over 4 months of age, $300 for a dog under 4 months of age.\n\n\u2022We require an additional $75 training deposit at the time of adoption. You will be required to enroll and complete a training class with your new companion at one of our approved training facilities. Once ALIVE Rescue Memphis receives proof of the completed class, this $75 deposit will be refunded.\n\n\nOur adoption application can be found at http://www.aliverescuememphis.org/memphis-nashville-adoptions\n\nDue to the extremely high volume of inquiries we receive, we ask that you submit an application immediately to start the adoption process. We try very hard to include all pertinent information in our bios. We are excited to help you find your new family member. However, ALIVE Rescue Memphis is operated 100% by volunteers. We want to spend our time saving dogs and assisting those adopters who have taken the time to complete an application. Thank you for understanding.\n\nBreed selection is done in conjunction with two local vets and is not to be considered a guarantee but rather a well-educated decision from well qualified staff.\n\nLIKE ALIVE Rescue Memphis on Facebook & Instagram!\nThanks for choosing rescue!!",

A little mouthy but we love it! He is potty trained and will let you know when he needs to go out. He is used to an apartment but would love to see him go to a place with a yard. He loves to chase the ball and sometimes he'll even bring it back. We are working more on fetching, chewing, table and leash manners. Crate trained. Great with kids. He is protective of my 4 year old and they are besfriends. He knows sit, Shake (both paws), down, wait (for food and to go through a door), leave it and usually comes when you whistle. He is in love with water. Loves going to the lake or just playing in the backyard with my little one with the water hose. He gets crazy spells where he just gets a bunch of energy and runs everywhere. Other than that he's been a very good dog! Adopt this beautiful sweet boy! \n\nApplications are at https://bit.ly/codys_adoption_application.\n\nCody's does not adopt puppies under the age of six months into apartment homes.",

She will thrive in a household with another big dog, free of kitties or small dogs. If you can provide this and are ready for a calendar girl, apply now!",

            "description": "Red is a laid back sweetheart. He is still very shy in his foster home but is starting to come out of his shell. He is quite happy to follow his foster mom/dad around and just watch what she/he is doing. He does great with the foster dogs in his house, big and small. People are still a bit scary to him, but he is slowly learning that they are nothing to be afraid of. He does love to chase the few rabbits that venture into our yard. He is a smart boy and has figured out how to get over our 4 foot fence so a 6 foot fence would be best. Due to Reds shyness he needs another bigger dog in his new house that will show him the ropes. He loves the German Shepherd in his foster house. He will even follow them on walks. He does fine being left out all day, he does not chew or bother anything in the house. He does not like loud noises and is afraid of thunder and fireworks. This sweet boy has the biggest heart, he is so laid back and is looking for a family that will take the time to show him what love really is. Red is a Lab/terrier mix, weighs 48 lbs and was born approximately X. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed, tested negative for heartworm disease and started on preventive. Adoption fee is $350 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyoldapps.wpengine.com/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

            "description": "Meet magnificent Max- This handsome pittie mix is looking for his forever person. At first glance, he might seem ferocious, but you'll soon find out that he's just ferociously goofy! Max can be a bit reserved when he meets new people, but once he warms up it's all about the belly scratches, ear rubs and snuggles. Max loves his person/pack and does not welcome strangers into the home or yard until he gets the ok from his people. Max responds well to a strong but loving leader and he is extremely food motivated. He is a very smart boy although it's sometimes overshadowed by his stubborness. Max is also potty-trained, crate-trained (yummy treat motivation needed since he's not a fan of the crate) and knows how to use a dog door. He will even sit and wait for his food until his person gives him the okay to eat. Max would love someone dedicated to continue teaching him leash skills and basic obedience training.\n\n This big boy has been living in his foster home for several months with a sassy 10 lb. terrier mix and they are good buddies- he even lets the little one boss him around. That being said, Max needs slow and proper introductions to other dogs and might do best as the only dog in the home so he can enjoy all your time and love for himself.\n\n Older children in the household would be preferred since Max isn't quite aware of his own strength and clumsiness in his tendency for rough play. Due to a very strong prey-drive, Max should not live in a home with cats. \n\n Some of his favorite activities? Going for car rides, patrolling the yard and chasing away all the bunnies and squirrels that dare to invade his territory and lounging in the sunshine. Indoors, he's a very mellow boy who enjoys snoozing on the couch, looking out the window to watch for critters that need to be chased, chewing on his bones and destroying soft, fluffy toys.\n\n If you think you might be the person he has been eagerly waiting for, please submit an application to meet magnificent Max today!\n\n*Homeownership required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration",

I am a 2 year old, 65 lbs, female, German Shepherd mix. I am a smart girl who is working on mastering all of that house and crate training business.  I am determined to get this stuff down and will be a professional in no time at all.  At first meet, I may be a little timid, but once I warm up we will be the best of friends.  I am a friend to other dogs and will need older children in my forever home. I would be fine living with a cat too.   I would also like to ask that I live in a house with a fence, so no apartment or big rig life for this big, active and sweet girl, please.  I need a home full of structure and routine. I thrive with it! My dream is to find an active family that will allow me join in on their adventures.  And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl forever, just fill out that application for me, Bellarini.\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

Her favorite toy is a ball and a log. She loves to chase small animals so no cats but especially loves to chase birds and airplanes. She walks great with other dogs and plays well with other dogs (outside of the home). Dakota is overly dominant and territorial in home when other dogs are present and does not get along with cats at all. She is friendly towards strangers and is great with children . She is fully house trained and crate trained. She has received formal obedience training. Dakota is in great health but does have a slight urinary incontinence which is control by medication Twice a week (DES). She is also very allergic to chicken and cannot have anything containing chicken products . Dakota is a very good dog and well trained however, she is very territorial in her own home (yard, house) and needs to be the only dog in the home.",

            "description": "Roux is a 6 year old, American Staffordshire Terrier mix. Roux is very loving with her human and bonds strongly, so would be a very loyal companion. She's good with cats but not other big dogs. She might do okay with little dogs. Roux is potty trained, crate trained and does well on leash. Roux is heartworm positive but undergoing treatment, which is covered by the rescue until she is negative. If you are interested in meeting Roux, please apply at www.hhfrescue.org. The adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

Now that her puppies have found their forever homes, she is blossoming as she becomes comfortable in her foster home.  She likes to play in the yard and go on walks, and then she will settle in nicely to occupy herself with her toys.  She's discovered that it's quite wonderful to be brushed, and she's eager to please and willing to learn.  She's been making great strides when meeting new people and warms up quickly.  It appears Clover may have missed out on some important experiences early in her life as she can be shy and looks to her person for reassurance in new situations, but she is gaining more and more confidence as time goes by.  Clover's biggest accomplishment of late is her interactions with the resident dogs in her foster home.  She lives with small and medium-sized dogs and they are teaching her appropriate canine social rules.  She's been a quick study; however, she still gets a bit carried away during play so a confident dog pal who doesn't mind a little rough-and-tumble play would be a good match for Clover.\n\nClover is house-trained, doesn't need a crate, but still needs some work on leash. She's a very strong girl!! We think Clover has so much potential and will continue to make great strides in her confidence with more experiences under her belt. If you're a shep lover with an understanding of all things shep, you could be the special person or couple to continue her life's journey.\n\nForever home: Clover would do best in an adult household with experienced dog owners who will continue to build her confidence.  She'd do fine as an only dog; however, she's recently shown interest in playing with the resident dogs.  So, it would appear she wouldn't say no to a compatible canine playmate.  Sorry kitties, but Clover is not a cat person.   She would not do well in an apartment/condo setting, and no electric fences, please.\n\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog, please complete the Adoption Application on our website, www.waggintailsdogrescue.org>Adopt>Adoption Application.\n \nADOPTION INFO:\n \nWe do not have a facility; all of our dogs are fostered in private homes.   We generally have two adoption events per month.  To meet a dog in person, please see our event calendar on our website for the date and time of the next adoption event. Arrangements can be made to meet a dog outside of Saturday adoption events after an application is submitted and approved.\n\nOur adoption process includes an application and in-home meet-n-greet with the dog.\n   \n-Adult Dog Adoption Fee - $225\n-Small Breed Adoption Fee - $275\n-Senior Dog Adoption Fee - $125\n-Pup Adoption Fee - $250 plus $50 spay/neuter deposit refunded upon proof of surgery by 6 mos.\n \nThank you for supporting dog rescue and your interest in a rescue dog!",

She walks especially well on a leash, doesn't pull and listens well. Jazzy does okay with other dogs with the proper introduction but tends to irritate them so we feel she's best as the only dog in the home.\n\nJazzy is about 4 years old, 45 pounds, spayed, up to date on shots, and microchipped. For more information on Jazzy please email us at goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com.\n\n***JAZZY IS CURRENTLY BEING FOSTERED IN HOUSTON, TX. Good Lif3 has adopted to more than 50 families in your area that would happily give a reference of their great experience adopting from us.

This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100% tax deductible.\n\nPrior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.\n\nOur adoption process begins with completing an application on-line.

A home with a yard to play fetch in and daily walks would be a dream come true for this active girl. She is looking for an experienced adopter and a cat-free home with teens-and-up. Jazzy would prefer to be the only pet in the home so she can get all the loves and cuddles to herself.\n\nJazzy is currently being fostered in Houston, TX. Good Lif3 has adopted to many very happy families in your area that would happily give a reference of their great experience adopting from us. We use an amazing ground transport that goes to your area twice a month\n\nJazzy is about 4 years old, 45 pounds, spayed, up to date on shots, and microchipped.

Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application.\n\nThe minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100% tax deductible.\n\nPrior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.\n\nOur adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

In fact, the more, the better.  She has a tendency to take things and chew them, but this is easily overcome by having the company of another dog.   She also should have a house, rather than an apartment, with free access to a yard. \n\nIf you need a friend for your active pup, this is the girl for you. \n\nIf you're interested in meeting Betty, please contact us for an application.

            "description": "Kurt von Kusel is a 2 year old working line German Shepherd.  He is bred to work and needs someone with the skill to be his alpha pack leader.  To be seen as a strong pack leader, his owner should be firm and consistent and also possess an air of self assurance. A confident dog, his owner must have the proper German Shepherd experience with confidence that exceeds his.  An adult only, quiet, calm environment - one without a lot of visitors - would suit him best.  He enjoys both physical and mental stimulation.  With the proper owner, Kurt is a devoted and faithful companion.  He knows several commands, responds well to positive reinforcement and is playful.  He is housebroken, crate trained and meets both female and male dogs well and is sociable.  If you are a calm, assertive, skilled pack leader, Kurt would be an amazing partner and best buddy!\n\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

BDRR saved her just in time so that she could have her babies in a safe environment. While she has enjoyed being a mom, she is truly dreaming about having a forever home. They staff says that she's very active and loves to play, especially with her toys. She's still got a lot of puppy energy and would benefit from some basic obedience training. She is also currently working on her leash manners. A home with older children would be best for Presley. With the proper guidance and love, she will make the best companion ever! I am looking for that special someone to adopt me and give me a forever home. If youre interested in adopting me, please visit our website and fill out the adoption form online at http://bdrr.org/adoption-form; Or contact Big Dog Ranch Rescue by Phone: (561) 791-6465 or (561) 309-3311; by Email: adoptions@bdrr.org",

            "description": "PAWS is currently closed due to COVID-19 and the mandated shutdown of non-essential businesses.  The animals are receiving the same high level of care as always, they'll just be staying with us a little longer.  During this time, we are taking application over the phone.  Until permitted to resume normal operations, we will be taking deposits and doing curb-side adoptions only.  We know it\u2019s difficult to choose a lifetime companion animal from a picture but it\u2019s been working out well for our adopters and most importantly, for the animals in our care. The financial impact is obvious but we're committed to keeping our community and our volunteers as safe as possible and providing the best of care for our animals.  Any donations are greatly appreciated to help PAWS provided that care.  Thank you.\n\nUPDATE: Dean has proved to be too rowdy for a home with little kids and may be best as an only child.  Some dogs he\u2019s ok with. Others not so much. So only pup is best. \nIntroducing Dean, an 18 month old sweetie who is looking for a dog savvy adopter who can teach him how to be the best dog ever.   He was very gentle and well behaved while doing his glamour shots.  He\u2019s very smart and seems quite eager to please those around him.  An adopter with experience with power breeds will be the best match for Dean.  We have discovered Dean\u2019s theme song. Ain\u2019t No Mountain High Enough!  This boy can clump darned near anything, especially a chain link fence. Did we mention how smart he is?  Dean will require a cat-free home. Dean is smaller than he looks, weighing in at 53 pounds.  His adoption fee is $175.\n\nAll of our animals are provided with age appropriate vaccinations, spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. \nPAWS has added the H3N2/H3N8 combo flu vaccine to its shot protocol. Every dog is being vaccinated upon intake, however we urge adopters to get a second flu shot for their new family member to ensure as much protection against the flu as possible.\nTo meet our incredible dogs and offer them the love they deserve, stop by PAWS on Friday, Saturday or Sunday from 10 - 4 PM, call us at 217-243-7297. We do applications in person or over the phone. You can also see pictures on our Facebook page, PAWS Jackson.  With an approved application, a deposit will hold your new best friend for up to 1 week to allow you time to come to PAWS.  This deposit is not refundable nor transferable.",

I recently had eye entropion surgery and am starting to feel so much better. I am a medium size girl. I am fun and friendly. I was at a rural shelter and was transferred to Furry Kids Refuge so I can find a loving home. I can be dog selective. A fenced yard would be best.\nI have been spayed, vaccinated, heartworm tested negative and microchipped. If you are interested in adopting me, please complete the adoption application located at www.furrykidsrefuge.org/adoptadog and a dedicated volunteer will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nFurry Kids' Refuge is in need of good quality dog and puppy food with meat as the first ingredient. You can drop off donations at our weekly adoption events at the Lee's Summit Petco (1860 NW Chipman Road, Lee's Summit, MO), Saturdays only from Noon to 4:00 p.m. Donations are tax deductible as allowed by law.\nWould you like to foster a Furry Kid? Furry Kids' Refuge will supply the food & vet care while you supply the basic house rules & love.......win-win for all!! Just visit our website http://www.furrykidsrefuge.org/category/fostering/ for more information. Thanks for your support!",

A neighbor contacted the owner and asked for the dog to find her a home. The owner agreed and that\u2019s how she came to FCSR. Taylor had bilateral cateracts with one eye enlarged from glaucoma. The vet recommended the eye removal for her comfort. Our awesome donors came through once again and we were able to get her the surgery. She has slight vision around the cataract in her remaining eye. Taylor is sweet, loving, and affectionate. She gets along with other dogs. If you are interested in adopting Taylor, please fill out an application at floridacocker.org or call 813-245-1833 if you have any questions.",

He prefers to be where the people are and will follow you from room to room or wait just on the other side of the closed door.  Camben is very good with other dogs of all sizes but is not good with cats, birds or other pocket pets. He warms up quickly to new people and has been introduced to children ages 1 to 16 with no issues. He is friendly with a moderate energy level and medium velcro tendencies. His favorite thing is riding in the car and he walks well on the leash. He is crate and house trained. So far Camben has not wanted to play with toys in his foster home but does like treats.  Camben prefers to eat his meals alone in his kennel. He will growl at his foster siblings if they are too close or nosey during meal time. He has not shown any other characteristics of resource guarding and takes treats softly and politely even in the group. Camben tested positive for heartworms, fortunately treatment is going well and we anticipate he will be healthy and ready to go to his forever home later this fall. Camben is fostered in Cimarron, KS.\n\nApplications for adoption can be submitted at www.ns4ar.org",

We fueled that fire inside of her with lots of TLC, and today Dana is doing wonderful. She is diabetic and will require special food and insulin for the rest of her life. The cost for these medications are not overly expensive but you do have to have regular vet visits to ensure her levels are where they should be. She is also blind due to the diabetes. Her foster has nothing but wonderful things to say about her and her recovery. \n\nShe is housebroken, and crate trained, and while this girl is newly blind and needs some guidance, she's maneuvering well in her foster home. She likes to carry her toys around and chew on them. Before she went blind she would try to chase the cats but now we don't believe she could find them as easily. She loves being doted on and groomed. Even enjoys her bath time! She is very treat motivated and takes treats gently. She knows sit and wait, and is a patient girl. She is not a fan of thunder, and fireworks, or gunshots, and will need some cuddle time during these events. She rides in the car well and is happy to tag along with you. She really is the sweetest, gentlest, most loving dogs, who just wants to be near her people at all times!\nDana is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER. Call with the pet's name and ID if you have questions on this pet. Save time, print out and bring our Pre-Adoption Form.",

Aaron stayed in her back yard for a few weeks until we had room for him. As you can see by the smile on his face, he is a very happy boy!! He is very sweet and loves everyone, including children and other dogs. Aaron is very active and high energy, so he will need a lot of exercise and play time from his new family, and he will give a lot of love in return! \n\nAaron's date of birth is 3/31/2019 and he weighs about 50 pounds. \n\nWe had a DNA test done on Aaron and found out he is 37.5% Boxer, 12.5% Belgian Malinois, 12.5% Standard Bulldog, 12.5% Labrador Retriever, and 25%Breed Groups: Asian, Herding, Sighthound. & Terrier.\n\nYou can submit an adoption application for this handsome boy at http://www.fayettefcar.com/applicationform, where you can also review FCAR\u2019s adoption requirements.\n\nAll FCAR adoptable dogs have been spayed or neutered, are current on all vaccines, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped, and come with a 30-day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required for Aaron.",

If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced.

We will have them neutered, vaccinated and chipped. Hiccup and Gizmo are good with other dogs and people them meet. They are playful without being hyper and generally well behaved. Hiccup and Gizmo don't have any behavioral issues or baggage. Hica has a happy small and will bring a lot of joy into any home. We will only adopt them out as a bonded pair.

He is super strong, energetic and goofy. \n\nBaron loves to go for walks, run around and play in his kiddie pool with water. Baron is LARGE and very strong and will require a family that is very experienced with bullies and or large breeds. \n\nBaron is a bit of a wild child and will need a family that will work on basic obedience training with him. He is working on not pulling on a leash and not jumping when he is excited. \n\nBaron is not good with other dogs and since he is so strong and large, will need a family that will keep him safe and be diligent about keeping him away from other dogs. We recommend kids over 16 in the home or an adult only home. No cats. Baron will need a fenced yard since he is energetic and loves to run around.\n\nBaron is UTD on shots, microchipped and neutered. His adoption fee is $400.",

TJ likes his crate and his room at the center, and will warm up to you, sit in your lap, and give you kisses if you go slowly. He loves his toys - especially squeaky ones. TJ doesn't like most dogs or children, but he loves walks. He'd be happy as an only dog with lots of attention...and toys. If you're interested in meeting TJ, go to adoptocpets.org/adopt, and download, complete, and email us your application.",

            "description": "Luke is a super playful five year old who decided to hang onto his puppy-ness! He loves to play and loves attention from his human family. He wants an active home where someone will play with him and let him be a lap dog. He has a stunning smile and is happy to meet everyone. He thinks he is a lap pet too and will gladly go for a car ride and sit on your lap if you let him. He seems to have an issue with other male dogs since he was neutered so late in life but has been great around females. We expect his issues with males to not last for long as his hormones can drive his brain for up to 6 months after neuter surgery. We want him to have a female fursister in the home because he really wants to have a fursister in his life. Sadly, Luke has flea-allergy dermatitis and will need to be faithfully given flea preventatives to prevent hot spots and sores from forming on his body. He also has heartworm disease, but the rescue will provide medication for slow kill treatment until he tests negative. Because we are foster based, we require an approved application before a meet and greet is scheduled. We think that is fair for our fosters so every meet & greet has the potential to result in an immediate adoption. The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online. We do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but we hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. Average adoption fees in our area are $175-$450 depending on the pet and the organization.\n\nWe work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

Danny Boy was not wearing a collar so there was neither an id tag nor a dog tag to enable us to locate his owner .. And he was not microchipped.\n\nDanny Boy has a dark brown/brindle short smooth coat with a large white bib on his chest, white paws, a long tail, and a sweet face with expressive brown eyes, a dusting of white on his muzzle, and short semi-erect ears. This good-looking guy has a happy outgoing disposition and a lovable affectionate personality. Danny Boy wiggles all over and wags his tail in anticipation of attention. He was in love with HSOV kennel tech Morgan Parsons and rewarded her with some great 'puppy kisses' after his photo session :)\n\nDanny Boy weighs 52.2 lbs. \n\nIn compliance with the Ohio Revised Code, Danny Boy was held for three days so that his owner would have an opportunity to reclaim him.  Sadly nobody came looking for him :(\n\nThis sweet boy seems to have a look of sadness in his eyes, and we look forward to the day when he is adopted by a fabulous individual or family and \u2018his Irish eyes are smiling\u2019 again.  \n\nDanny Boy will be neutered in the near future (tentatively on October 28, 2020) and will be ready to find the home of his dreams.\n\nUPDATE: Danny Boy was neutered on October 28, 2020 and was also given rabies vaccine.\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019m BLUEWATER-- I'm a husky/shepherd mix (born 3/31/2020) on an Indian Reservation in Arizona. I got a one way ticket onto The Rescue Train and came to Los Angeles with my 11 siblings and my momma when I was just 6 weeks old.

I'd love an adopter who is committed to continuing my training so I can grow to be an awesome adult dog.\n\nI\u2019m off to a great start learning crate training. My favorite activities include (but are not limited to) learning, playing with my toys, meal time, chewing on my nylabone, and belly rubs and being told I\u2019m a good boy.\n\nIf you are looking for a smart active companion to do fun stuff with I hope you will come meet me!\n\n---\nIf you are interested in adopting BLUEWATER please fill out our adoption application on www.therescuetrain.org.

BLY IS GOOD ON LEASH AROUND OTHER DOGS BUT MUST BE THE ONLY PET IN THE HOUSEHOLD-\n\nArf! I\u2019m BLY-- I'm a husky/shepherd mix (born 3/31/2020) on an Indian Reservation in Arizona. I got a one way ticket onto The Rescue Train and came to Los Angeles with my 11 siblings and my momma when I was just 6 weeks old. I\u2019m now a big girl that\u2019s ready to leave the nest and am looking to be your new best friend! I am one of the \"edgier\" littermates so my adopter needs to be very experienced with my breed. \n\nBeing that I'm just a young adult, I am still learning how to be the best dog I can be. The Rescue Train has been working with a certified professional dog trainer and has invested a lot into my future! I'd love an adopter who is committed to continuing my training so I can grow to be an awesome adult dog. I'd do best in a home without small children or other pets. I do very well on leash around other dogs, but must be the only pet in the household.\n\nI\u2019m off to a great start learning crate training. My favorite activities include (but are not limited to) learning, playing with my toys, meal time, chewing on my nylabone, belly rubs and being told I\u2019m a good girl.\n\nIf you are looking for a smart, active companion to do fun stuff with I hope you will come meet me!\n\n---\nIf you are interested in adopting BLY please fill out our adoption application on www.therescuetrain.org.

            "description": "Meet Patches -- she is a very sweet 4 year old Jack Russell Terrier. Patches was surrendered when she could not stand with her rear legs. It turned out that Patches had a disk issue and was in a tremendous amount of pain. After crate rest and physical therapy, she is much better now, and no longer seems to be hindered by pain. \n\nPatches did have a weight problem, but since she is now able to get exercise she has trimmed down nicely. She remains on a special diet, and her snacks are limited to mini training treats, celery, green beans and carrots, all of which she loves. \n\nPatches also loves long walks, car rides, play time, and will snuggle up when she is ready for a rest. She is a very funny dog, and keeps her foster mom laughing with her antics. She LOVES to cuddle up under a blanket, and will burrow under one till she gets it just the way she wants it. She is crate trained, and goes into it and gets completely under her blanket when she is ready to go to bed. In the morning, she patiently waits in her crate till it's time to get her day started. She is potty trained and will let you know when she needs to go out. She's a smart pup, is learning to sit and stay, and seems to enjoy training sessions. \n\nShe loves meeting new people, and after enthusiastically greeting them, lays down on her back for a belly rub. Because of her excitability she would do best in a home without young children or other dogs. She has lots of energy and needs plenty of exercise.\n\nWe would love to see our wonderful Patches unite with her forever family!\n\n\nIf you are interested in Patches, click 'Apply for Adoption'!\n\nIf you're on Adopt-A-Pet or PetFinder, please visit 'https://www.hopeanimals.org/' to apply!\n\n\n** Please note that due to COVID-19 and stay at home orders, we are not having our usual adoption events. The first step in the process is to submit an online application. Virtual meet and greets over the phone/computer will be set up before selecting the best fit for adoption. Thank you!",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 6/16/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Found as stray by a caregiver\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? none\nWeight: 38.60 lbs\nHeight: 20 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Ringo would enjoy any home that is full of hustle and bustle. He wants to be active and the center of his family's life. Ringo will be best as an only dog. He would love a home where someone is home during the day - he has some separation anxiety and needs to learn that people do come back. Ringo would enjoy an active, outdoor lifestyle. He would do well with children over 12. Ringo's high energy is ready for adventure.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Ringo is a young, happy dog who enjoys life. He is full of sunshine and all things wonderful about a dog. Ringo will be a close companion and prefers to check in for physical touch to make sure everything is OK. He may nuzzle a leg, sit closely or walk right next to you. When Ringo is playing with his friends, he is full steam ahead. When playtime is over, he will seek you out for snuggles and rest.\n\nRingo does not enjoy life in a crate. He has shown some separation anxiety when crated away from his pals and caregivers. He is overjoyed when he is reunited with his pals and our caregivers. Ringo is working on leash manners. He doesn't know any basic commands yet, but is very eager to please and would benefit from dedicated training to help him learn. Ringo will need training to understand his people will always return and time apart is normal.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Ringo thinks everyone is his new forever friend. He will greet you with wiggles and wags.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Ringo's estimated birthday is 6/16/2019\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

She has shown absolutely no aggression but she does have a lot of anxiety in addition to separation anxiety. She is currently living with lots of other large dogs and gets along great with them. She tends to be rather submissive -- does not like confrontation from other animals or humans. She does not do well in a kennel!! German shepherd experience would be a plus. She is very much a representative of her breed. Very intelligent and wants to be protective. She just needs a family that can allow her to just enjoy life and be a dog, Playing and romping and loving on her humans! \n\nIf interested in adopting Taro, please fill out an application here https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/1303484",

            "description": "**SPECIAL NEEDS, PLEASE READ FULL BIO**\n\nEclipse came into rescue when her previous owner realized that she had unknown medical needs that she could not afford to get diagnosed or treated.  She knew she needed help, and selflessly surrendered her so that she could get the medical care that she needed.  \n\nAfter a month in foster care we started the journey of finding out exactly what was causing this young girl to stumble, buckle her front and back legs and fall over. \n\nAfter x-rays and an MRI it was determined that Eclipse had wobblers disease (a genetic compression of the spine) and a secondary issue of a spinal cyst.  This is a lot for a 16 month old, to have going on.  \n\nThe good news was that Eclipse was young, had a zest for life and was otherwise a healthy Dane.  The decision was made that we needed to do what we could to give this amazing girl the life that she deserves. She had surgery in mid September to decompress her spinal cord (wobblers correction) and remove a cyst that had formed on her spine near the compression.  This was a difficult surgery, with a very long recovery time, and the expectation was that Eclipse may not walk or stand for more than 2 weeks, and could need assistance to walk for MONTHS.  But we were up for the challenge.  \n\nDid I mention that Eclipse was a fire cracker? Well, she took the fast track, and walked out of the vets office on her own with just a bit of assistance with a harness.  Just a few days after being back in foster care she was becoming difficult to keep down and resting, she started to take her caregivers for walks, rather than them assisting her, she wanted  to chase the chickens and ducks at her foster home. She has defied all odds in her recovery, this due to her happy, vivacious personality.\n\nIt's been three months post surgery now, and she still walks a bit wonky. At her recheck the specialist discovered that her wobbler's compression has been completely corrected but that her spinal cyst had come back. This means she could require additional surgery at a later date. \n\nWhat to know about Eclipse; she is a 1.5 year old pup with the stamina of the Energizer Bunny, she has 2 speeds - full out play and sleeping.  She loves other dogs and has done well with every dog she has met, large,small, male or female. She would likely do fine with cats if properly introduced, but she does play rough, so it would need to be a dog savvy cat.  \n\nEclipse requires a house with no stairwells or lots of steps. She really needs to have a playmate in the house, when bored she tends to get into mischief, chewing on things, taking things off the counter etc. she is a counter surfer, and she has no shame, she will take what she wants right in front of you.  Eclipse is crate trained, and needs to be crated when left in the house alone, she will chew moldings and furniture if left free roam for too long in the house.  Eclipse needs some work on leash manners, and due to her spinal surgery will need to use a harness rather than a collar and leash.   She will run if left loose outside of a fence, she\u2019ll comeback, but not until she is ready, and the chase is a lot of fun for her!  Eclipse has mastered the art of cuddles, she loves to lay on your lap and get some love, and when she wants attention she nudges her way into your space to let you know that she needs your undivided attention.  Eclipse has shown no food aggression, loves toys, but is willing to share, she has no boundaries with other dogs, so she needs to have tolerant, patient dog buddies in her forever home, that are willing to put up with her constant pestering to play.  Eclipse has a cute little habit of giving love nibbles, she does this to both her fur buddies and her humans, she seems to do it when she is happy and content,  foster mom calls them Clipsy love nibbles.  \n\nAre you Eclipses family? If you have the energy, for this girl she will repay you with mountains of love, a ton of laughs at her silly antics and the best cuddles ever!  She was dealt a rough hand physically, but she has proven that nothing will get her down! \n\nEclipse's adoption fee is $400 To apply to adopt Eclipse go to www.nwflgdr.com/adopt.\n\nATTENTION: NWFLGDR does not transport. If you are applying from out of area or out of state, understand that if your application gets approved, you will be expected to pick up the dane in the location that he/she is being fostered. In addition, if the adoption does not work out, it is your responsibility to bring the dane safely back to us.",

Abby has been described by her caregivers as both playful and a snuggly potato, making her the perfect double-threat for an owner who enjoys a balanced lifestyle of activity and couchsurfing. Abby will need to be the only pet in the home, but she is all you will need. When well-acquainted with her new family, Abby would make a wonderful companion on easy hikes, swims, and other light outdoor fun. She's also well-mannered when left home by herself, knows certain hand signals and knows how to \"hold it\". Abby is still a young dog with most of her life ahead of her with a real interest in training. She'll make the perfect companion for years to come when provided with the patience, love and training to be her best self.

We were first introduced to Cafe when he was just a young puppy who found himself abandoned at one of our partner shelters Miami-Dade Animal Services. He was very ill and received life-saving emergency medical care for two weeks and just like a great cup of coffee he came back even stronger. Once he received the all-clear our partners transported him up to us so we could assist him on his road to recovery. As a puppy, you couldn't deny the adorableness that was his wobbly legs and floppy ears but as we got to know him we noted Cafe would need a family willing to offer structure and guidance in order to teach & nurture a well-balanced dog. We are unsure what Cafe's past experiences were like, but they were during such an important stage in a puppy\u2019s life. His true nature mixed in with his poor experiences was hindering him in ways we knew he would need careful guidance to overcome.  Cafe was adopted and he loved his new life very much but as he continued to physically grow and mentally mature his family realized their lifestyles just were not the right blend. He found himself back in our care and desperate for a new direction in life. Cafe is an enthusiastic boy that if left to his own devices will cause a bit of trouble but when pointed in the right direction that lively spirit can be used for so much good. He will tackle any agility course equipment with such eagerness just so you can give him a bit of praise. He has flourished with us in our training program and the skills he has learned will help him and his new family enjoy many fun adventures together. He truly does rely on one of his trusted humans to show him that something he might not have ever been exposed to before is safe to touch, explore, and possibly enjoy. He works harder for physical attention than any treat you can offer him but if treats are in play his taste buds truly jump for the world-renowned tiny sized basic milk bone. If you ask any of our staff one of our favorite things about Cafe is no matter the mood you are in his full body wiggle to greet you will fill your cup over with joy!\n\nIf you find yourself in need of an instant energy boost this robust blend just might be the pick for you!\n\nTo adopt Cafe, please fill out our adoptions questionnaire here: https://forms.gle/5heEH8S6c7zXBneD7\n\nContact our Adoptions team at adoptions@adoptadog.org or (914) 273-1674 for more information!",

My sister Josie and I were surrendered together when our family could no longer keep us. We then enjoyed a foster home and we are proud to say we are dog, cat, and well-behaved children friendly. I am an extremely shy girl and absolutely MUST join a home with another dog. I do best when I am with a companion who is very confident to help me feel more comfortable in new situations. While I am child friendly, it may be best for me to live in a home without children at the moment where I can learn to be more sure of myself. I would definitely benefit from an experienced dog owner who knows how to bring pups like me out of their shells. I'd be happiest in a home with a large yard for me to run around in, particularly because I am not currently very fond of walking on the leash. I would benefit from continued training and would be happiest in a quiet home.",

WE WILL BE UNABLE TO RESPOND TO APPLICATIONS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA. *** Marlin is a 9 month old neutered male Pomsky. He is a very high energy guy and needs a home with a fenced yard, and a family that will provide extensive exercise, including running, hiking or doggy daycare. He has been bounced around to several homes in his short life and is needing a family who can continue with his training and rehabilitation of resource guarding issues. He must be supervised and redirected when playing with other dogs, as he has some obsessive traits and he is not recommended for a home with cats or young children. If you're interested in meeting or adopting Marlin, the first step would be filling out an adoption application via our website scsheltierescue.com.

Thankfully he belongs to us now and is ready to be adopted. Be sure to check out his video from our Puppy Playground.\nChester will need an experienced dog handler and should not be in a home with cats or other small animals.

He is crate trained.  He surprised me by going out doggie door.  \nHe is eating well and pottying outdoors MOST of the time (pooped inside once). \nHe doesn\u2019t ask to go out, I just take him every hour or two.  \nHe barks when I\u2019m fixing his dish.  Loves to cuddle.  Demands it actually. \nI think he\u2019d do well in any home as long as the other dogs don\u2019t run him over and the home has no more than one step\u2014 even to go out.  \nBecause he tries to do them.  What a lovely boy!\nAlbert does have weakness in his backend from mild IVDD.\n\nHis adoption fee will be $375.00 which includes neuter, full vax, microchip, HW & parasite negative, dental (if needed) and any other medical issues treated.\n\nAlbert is currently being fostered in Decatur, Al. \n\nBecause of volume, we do not answer questions on this page.\n\nHouse Trained: Most of the time\nCrate Trained: Yes\nKid Friendly: Unknown at this time\nCat Friendly: Unknown at this time\n\nYou may apply to adopt at www.tndachshundrescue.com\n\nA little about how the adoption process works:\nWe are an all volunteer rescue so please be patient with us.\nWe usually have pre-approved adopters waiting for the right dog so it is best to get your application approved beforehand so you can contact us immediately when you are interested in meeting a potential pet.\n\nYou will be contacted once the app is processed for a home visit.\nIf you are already approved and see a dog you are interested in, please contact your adoption coordinator.\n\n\nCheck our FaceBook page at: https://www.facebook.com/tndachshundrescue/",

He\u2019s very affectionate, calm and laid back. \nHe had 2 spots of hair loss. On the right side of his face and on his back. It looked like the hair was starting to grow back so I\u2019m not sure what it was. He also had 2 small lumps/masses. One on his front right leg and one on the right side of his face. Both didn\u2019t seem to be painful and they were soft.  Treated for HW's.   boxer mix; male; stray; 7/27; 4-5 yrs old; 56lbs.  Adopted mid October and returned early December as he kept getting out of underground fence.\n\nMr Doting! \u00a0My new volunteer friends called me Mr Doting, Mr Chill Master and Mr Attentive! \u00a0All labels suit me just fine and make me smile. \u00a0 I'm a bigger boy with a big, blocky head all primed and ready to nicely sit by your side and keep you company. \u00a0I had a nice time running and exploring in one of the enclosed areas and when the pretty caramel colored female dog, Caramel came to say \"Hi,\" well she really completed my fun excursion. \u00a0 We respectfully greeted each other and in no time were relaxing side by side and the whispering secrets below the long cement bench! \u00a0 My human friends noted that I'm a smart fellow who enjoys giving paw and nicely sitting when asked. \u00a0 Sweet and loving, \u00a0slightly older kids would be a good match for me and a more submissive doggy companion (preferably female) would nicely compliment my bigger personality. \u00a0 \u00a0Ask for me, Rooster today! \u00a0And cock-a-doodle-do!\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rv1WceVR_A",

I have no idea how I ended up there; my foster mom says I am the best boy ever! I LOVE everyone I meet! I come, sit, and even wait for my dinner nicely! I love to go jogging with my human foster brother, play with my doggie foster siblings, and I know to leave the cats here alone! I am crate trained and don't potty in my foster house! I am very athletic and love to do stunts that my foster mom trains me to do! I will go over, under, around, and through just about anything I am told to, but I also know to mind my manners in the house! My foster mom tells me that there is a perfect family waiting to find me. I just wonder if they are as excited to meet me as I am to meet them! I can hardly wait!\n\nEmail info@fayettehumane.org to speak to an adoptions volunteer.

All expenses paid by the rescue**\n\nHey! We're now best friends! My name is Otto and if you like big, fuzzy goofballs, I'm your pup! I love new friends both two and four-legged. I love a good grooming sesh so much that I can doze off while having a paw-dicure. My foster mom says I'm \"a little extra\" but I'm sure she means extra soft and extra handsome!\n\nMy doctors (who are also my best friends) say I've got Neuronal Degeneration, which means when I run I do a great impression of a kangaroo! It also means I might know you really made that breakfast for me but I don't have the balance to pull it off the counter, knock over trash cans, or jump on your furniture. I'll be livin' my best life if there aren't any stairs to my yard and carpet or rugs inside for traction.\n\nThe house I live in now has stairs but I don't pay them any attention. Don't feel sad if I don't follow you up, I'm just a single story kinda dog. I'm perfectly happy sleeping downstairs and catching some me time. I'll doze on your lap if you sit with me but sometimes I prefer napping outside connecting with my inner pyr!\n\nOtto is looking for a for a long term medical foster home. Is that you?\n\nAll our dogs require secure VISIBLE fencing. All current pets in adoptive home must be spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nAdoption Fee: N/A- Needs Medical Foster\n\nAdoption applications can be found on our website: www.greatpyrsandpaws.org\n\nhttps://greatpyrsandpaws.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=5959\n\n2/2/21 5:36 PM",

            "description": "Looking for a smart, energetic dog buddy to be your activity companion? Ghost loves to go for long walks and jogs, especially if he can get away from the busy city streets. He also enjoys his playtime...he LOVES to roll in the grass and running full speed in the yard and tumbling head over heels like a gymnast :) He's very smart and picks up most new commands in minutes. With just a few days training he can add to his new trick arsenal - his focus is razor sharp! Ghost is a very cuddly dog and showing his affection to his family is important to him. Even at nap times this sweet boy would like to have one paw on a human. Ghost loves other dogs and loves to play with them. He would benefit in a home with a more experienced dog that can guide him and help him learn the boundaries and rules of his new home. Cats are fine and he often ignores them, though he would prefer if one played or cuddled with him :) He'd also do fine as the only dog, providing he gets plenty of attention and activity stimulation. We don't know much about Ghost's past but he is missing part of his ear and back toe so he may have been attacked when he was younger. His quirky ear perfectly captures his curiosity and goofball nature, and he doesn't seem to mind his toe which certainly hasn't slowed him down (all foot xrays are clear). He also has an issue with one of his hips which is managed with glucosamine, and again, does not slow him down one bit. Ghost will need an experienced Pyr owner to continue his training and bring out the best in this boy!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/rescue-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

Due to the corona virus pandemic, AARF is not holding adoption fairs at this time.  Please see our adoptable dogs and submit an on-line application at AARFWS.org.  We will check references and set up an appointment for you to  meet with the dog(s).\n\nJosie is a 2 yr old, 53 lb Australian shepherd/lab mix. J\n\n\nJosie\u2019s sweet spirit is a testament to her resilience after a difficult start in life. Though always loved, Josie spent her first months in a confined environment, without much socialization or exercise\u2014a tough combination for her breed. But she has come such a long way! She is the sweetest, most playful dog, with a lot of energy; she craves attention and activity, and she will reward your efforts with boundless joy and affection. Her favorite activities are stealing socks, barking at people out the window, and fetch (which she often takes up a notch by demanding to be chased). Although she absolutely loves meeting other dogs, she probably is best suited for a single-pet household. She adores kids and would make a wonderful family companion! She loves lots of attention, will benefit from lots of exercise, and loves to play fetch with a trusty tennis ball. Josie would love a fully fenced yard, if possible.",

He is 90lbs of muscle and is 100% potty-trained, loves other dogs, and is great with kids! Just watch out for his constantly wagging tail. Bane is a sweet guy who loves to give kisses. He loves to play with his toys and loves tug of war the best. He likes to sleep with his foster momma and hog the bed. He is chill and laid back. He likes to go for short walks but needs a strong handler due to his size. He prefers to be uncrated and would do best in a household where someone is home often.",

            "description": "Meet Trey!  He was born approximately November 2017.  Trey started coming to one of our volunteer's homes and was chasing her outdoor kitties.  She chased him away multiple times but he kept coming back.  After doing this many times, she took him to the vet and had him checked for a microchip but he had none.  She posted notices but no one came forward to claim him.  Trey is very loving and super smart.  Unfortunately, he chases cats when they run but doesn't hurt them.   A home with cats would not be a good fit.   He is a great watchdog.  Nothing gets by him and he barks to alert that someone is coming.  During the time he's been fostered, we have noticed he likes children.  We believe his original owners had children.  Do you think you\u2019re a match for Trey?  Trey an indoor only dog, except for potty breaks and requires a secure fenced yard. \n\nTrey is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, deflead and available for adoption through Second Chance Kitty, a local non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to assisting cats, kittens and an occasional dog, escape a life of abandonment, abuse and neglect. Interested parties may contact us via email at 2chancekittys@gmail.com.  An application may be submitted at www.secondchancekitty.org.  A home visit is required.",

He was rescued by the Police who were called by the Coroner to take him out of a home where the parent had passed away.  There was no where to take the grieving little fellow, except a high kill shelter, which only made matters worse.  One of our rescue friends stopped by and he gravitated to the cage door and put his little paw through the links and cried.  Of course the rest is History and he is here with Us!  Guy is very alert, affectionate, in good health and loves to be snuggled, and goes for walkies tucked inside his foster mom's hoodie!  Guy loves to snuggle up close to watch television, help her work on her computer, read books with her and of course make her feel safe as he snuggles up close through the night.  This is a lovely and wonderful little man.  If you would like to meet him, please text or call 778-896-1439 or email cherrybim@shaw.ca",

Deep down he is just very insecure and tries to act fierce to make up for it, but when he bonds and picks his person he is just as fierce in his devotion and loyalty.  He has an independent streak as well and likes his space at times.  Suki does well with other small dogs in his foster home and we think he might feel more secure living as part of a \u201cpack\u201d.  He does tend to bond and protect one person so is looking for an adult home preferably with just one person he can devote himself to, and someone that understands the chihuahua breed and their quirks and issues.  \n\nPlease email njwoof@cs.com to meet him by appointment and submit an application from our website www.secondchance.petfinder.com\n\n\nDue to COVID-19, we will not be holding our Sunday adoption events until further notice, but we can schedule socially distant appointments with a specific dog outdoors at our vet\u2019s office:\nVCA Morris Plains Animal Hospital \n3009 Rt 10 East \nMorris Plains (Denville on GPS) NJ 07950\nNow is the perfect time to open your home to a needy dog!  Submit an application from our website www.secondchance.petfinder.com to speed up the adoption process\nAll our dogs reside in foster care in Northern NJ until adoption. We are a small all-volunteer organization focused on rescuing local dogs from area shelters, as well as accepting some surrenders and puppy mill rescues. \n",

I lived on the streets for a while and people scared me even though I now know they were just trying to help me. I love all dogs and really enjoy hanging out in my crate with the door open. I\u2019m a good girl and haven\u2019t chewed up anything in the home but I do enjoy relocating shoes so my humans can\u2019t find them. Leashes still really scare me. I live with 4 kids but my foster mom thinks I would do better in a calmer house with no kids. It will take me time to warm up to my new family but with treats and time I will come along. I do not like cuddling but I will lay in bed with you just not too close please. I was born in July 2016.\n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

            "description": "Ivy is looking for a special family. Not just any family- a VERY special family that will understand she\u2019s had a difficult and scary life. Ivy was rescued from a puppy mill. She arrived at NGPR very unfamiliar with human interaction and scared of almost everything. Despite her fears, she is a very sweet girl. She is making progress but has a long way to go. Ivy prefers to be indoors in her crate, where she knows she is safe. She will venture out, once she is comfortable, to lay with her humans for short periods of time, but her new family will need to be very patient and give her lots of time to adjust. As a result of Ivy\u2019s fears, house training has been a work in progress. Her new family will need to help her understand that she is safe going to the bathroom outside. She is currently being taken out every couple of hours to avoid accidents in the house. Ivy seems more comfortable going outside at night than during the day. She is good on a leash but is too nervous to go out for walks in the neighborhood. Ivy doesn\u2019t have any basic obedience training. Due to her anxiety, bad behavior hasn\u2019t really been an issue as she doesn\u2019t venture anywhere she could get in trouble. Ivy\u2019s perfect home is a quiet home, perhaps out in the country, as loud neighborhood noises make her very scared. Ivy would benefit from another confident dog to help her feel more secure and show her the world is not so scary. She's looking for a family that doesn\u2019t need immediate love and affection from their dog, but Ivy will thank you for your endless patience in different ways. Watching her very slowly come out of her shell will be the best reward for her new people. We understand that a dog like Ivy is not for everyone, this special girl requires a special place to live. We know the perfect family is out there for her. If you have a quiet home filled with patient, understanding and loving humans--well then maybe it\u2019s the pyrfect retreat for sweet Ivy.\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

I am an unbelievably sweet girl from North Carolina that picked up and care for temporarily until my stray hold as the shelter had many calls about me wandering around and people were being mean and throwing rocks at me to get me off their property and someone even drove me several miles away to get rid of me but found my way back. I was very thin and the heat was getting to me so the shelter there asked this nice rescue to take me in, thank God! Now I am so happy to be in a loving cool home and I am am enjoying good food too! I have been to the Vet since arriving and it seems that I am almost blind so it is a miracle that I was not killed when the folks in NC were being so nasty to me and  not helping me at all. I am pretty malnourished now and diabetic from all the neglect but I am still nothing but sugar and spice and everything nice. I love attention and relish any love given to me and boy do I love a good belly rub! I am good with other dogs and slightly curious about the cat but I would never hurt a thing. I am crate trained but I do not like the crate very much and you do need to be able to let me out and keep me on a schedule. If you would like to adopt me, please fill out an application on the rescue's website www.floprva.org that is always the first step to be considered to adopt from this rescue who saved my life, just for you! \n\nLove, Hazel xo",

She is a lovely girl with one brown eye and one blue eye. Angel C is deaf. As a result she can be a bit shy and unsure when in a new environment. When she is feeling secure, Angel is all sweetness. She loves to have her belly rubbed and gives precious kisses. Curling up in a comfy human lap is heaven to her. Because of her deafness Angel C will need formal training, preferably in sign language. Knowing what she is expected to do will be critical to her happiness and comfort.\n\nVisit Angel C at www.hua.org!",

At around 55 lbs, she is on the larger side of medium, but her short legs make her appear more demure! We would call her a medium energy dog as she will run and play as long as she wants, she would prefer a fenced in yard!! She loves to rest her head on your shoulders and get hugs. Marla looks at each toy as a deconstruction challenge. She will show you exactly what its made of so you know for next time :). She does well with dogs one on one, mostly boys, with slow introductions. She must be in a cat-free home due to the hound in her. She also would do best in a home with older kids due to her lack of boundaries. She is house trained, does NOT love her crate but tolerates it, and does not show any food aggression at all (with dogs or humans)! She is very smart and is doing well learning her commands. She really would love a home where she could get hugs and kisses all day, walks and a nice fenced back yard! \n\nMarla is a four year old, 55lb, female Hound mix. As part of her $250 adoption fee, she is spayed, microchipped, and up-to-date on vaccines, and monthly flea/tick and heart worm preventatives. If you have questions about Marla, you can email Dogteam@pawsforlifenc.org. If you wish to adopt Marla, you can fill in an online application for her here: http://pawsforlifenc.org/pet-adoptions/apply-for-adoption/.",

            "description": "UPDATE:  Rio has been doing fantastic in his foster home.  He goes to play group and has a blast playing with other dogs.  He is still shy with humans, during this quarantine he has his bubble of humans, so getting him to warm up to a new human may take him a little bit.  A family with another dog, preferably female might make the transition easier.  His foster mom has done such a great job with Rio and given him the sense of what being part of a family can be like.  \nRio and sister River were finally caught.  They had been seen swimming back and forth across the river for a while.  They obviously had not been socialized and no one knows how long they had been on their own.  Rio is about 8 months old.    Please call the shelter if you are interested in Rio since he is in foster care.   My adoption fee is $125-150 which includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations,  heartworm disease test,  microchip/registration fee and collar .  ADOPT ME TODAY and find a friend for life!   And remember that adopting a pet is a life long commitment.",

The adopter is the alpha member of the pack, and the dog or puppy needs as much one-on-one contact with the alpha as possible. For this reason, all Route 66 Rescue Inc. dogs are adopted to inside homes only. They must be on leash, or inside a secure fence when outside, and not left outside alone when no one is home. Invisible fencing does not qualify as protection since other animals and strangers have access to the dog. The dogs must be returned to Route 66 Rescue, Inc. if ever given up by the adopter. Thank you for understanding we want only the best for the dogs you give a forever home.\n \nPlease complete and return the adoption application to meet any of our adoptable dogs.\nhttp://www.route66rescueinc.com/adoption-application.html Thank you for visiting our site.

His first few days at the shelter, Kodak was heartbroken and untrusting of staff. With cheese and hotdogs, we quickly won him over and now, he hasn't stopped smiling! Kodak is a BIG boy (90lbs) who was not given much structure in his previously home, but he is responding very well, with staff here at the shelter.\nHe's a big mush who loves having his ears rubbed and belly pet. Staff have been working with him on leash manners and commands but he would benefit from an experienced bully or large breed owner who can continue working with him. Kodak previously lived with other dogs but would do best as an only dog. Kodak should not be placed with cats or small animals. Due to his size, Kodak needs to be placed with older children. \nIf interested in meeting this big boy, please contact Vicki@nokillarc.org",

He came from a crowded shelter in New Mexico where he was turned found as a stray. Since we have little history on him, we are estimating his age to be around 1-2 years old and think he might be a Cattle Dog/Husky mix due to his working drive and gorgeous eyes..\n\nDuke is a playful guy who loves people. He is a high energy dog who needs mental and physical exercise and would do great in an active household or as an exercise buddy. He is a smart dog and knows some basic commands but would benefit from continued basic obedience and leash skill building. Duke is working on his manners with other dogs, and would be best suited living with a tolerant dog his size or as an only dog. Duke doesn't do well with cats or small dogs and would do best living in a home (no apartments or condos) with children 12 or older.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Duke, please submit an adoption application located on our website, coloradocaninerescue.org. We are asking for a $200 adoption donation. Duke is neutered, housebroken, up to date on vaccinations and microchipped.\n\nCCR cannot hold dogs, arrange meet and greets or adopt out any dogs without a completed adoption application.\n\nCCR cannot guarantee the breed composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the shelter.\n\nDogs listed as potty trained may experience an adjustment period as they learn the routines in their new home.",

I am currently hanging out with what they call a foster family. I have a foster mom, three four-legged foster brothers and an old crotchety foster sister! I like other dogs and want to play more, but these guys are pretty low key! \n\nI spend my free time chewing on bones and toys-I could do it for hours. My foster mom gives me LOADS of stuff to chew on so I do not go and find stuff I am not allowed to chew!  I was not introduced to many new people in my first home, so I bark at people and can be very shy when I meet new folks. My foster mom has been taking me to new places and I am meeting new people! Once I am comfortable, I LOVE to cuddle and be beside you. I just need a little time to trust you. I like going on small walks and enjoy that time with humans! I prefer the big two legged as the little ones make so many crazy noises and run  around and that scares the tar out of me and I will bark and growl to try to keep those little terror machines away!  I have been working on my confidence building skills and I am learning to love trying new things! \n\nMy rescue family has taken me to a training class and they reward me for trying new things- those rewards are great- they call them treats!!! I  LOVE treats! I do not think I have tried one that I did not find delicious! My foster mom says I will be taking another class and I can not wait! Maybe my forever family will take me too!! \n\nI am learning this world has many great things to offer and may not be as scary as I originally thought. I am currently recovering from surgery because I kept having what the vet called UTIs. I had to potty all the time! It was awful. Because of this, I am not what my foster mom calls house-trained. She says this surgery should really help me not have to potty so much and we can start working on that soon! \n\nWell, I gotta go- lots of bones to chew!! Hope to meet you soon!\n\nOur adoption process starts with our application. Once the application is approved, a member of Legacy will contact you to set up a home visit. The home visit usually last 1-1 1/2 hours and is to make sure our dog and any current dogs/cats are getting along, as well as both of us agreeing it's a fit. At this time the adoption fee is due, and begins the 2 week trial. We will check in during the 2 week trial. If it's not working, our dog is returned to the foster home and all except $100.00 {$75 if Senior} of the adoption fee is returned. At the end of the 2 week trial, you decide if you will finalize the adoption - if finalized, the Adoption Contract is signed and all medical records are turned over to you. If at any time you need to rehome the dog it contractually needs to be returned to Legacy Dog Rescue.\n\nADOPTION FEE's:\nPuppies under 6 months:  $199.00\nAdults:  $150.00\nSeniors (over 7 yrs):  $99.00\n\nIf you are interested in one of our dogs please fill out an application: \nhttps://form.jotform.com/193425528783165",

            "description": "Helen came to us from a owner who had to move and could not take her along. This is heartbreaking since Helen is a special dog, she cannot see or hear. Could you imagine loosing your home, your owners and not being able to navigate this world? Well, Happy Hearts came to the rescue.\n\nHelen is a 2 year old Belgium Mal and is thriving in her foster home. She is now showing signs of affection, love and confidence. Plus, she gets along well with the other small pup in the home!\n\nHelen is incredibly smart and will need a strong, dedicated owner who can give her a daily job or activite to help her feel fulfilled. She can socialize with other dogs, large and small, but should be supervised.\n\nSince she e is lacking hearing and sight and requires proper guidance. She is completely dependent on her nose, taste, vibrations, and her owners guidance.\n\nIt has taken a lot of time, training and resources to see her come this far.\n\nAre you interested in meeting Helen or donating to her cause? If so, please let us know!\n\nInterested in learning more, let us know! https://happyheartsgsr.org/\n#gsd #gsdrescue #adoptme #adoptdontshop",

            "description": "Meet Benz! Benz holds a special place in a lot of people's hearts. He's one that we will be very picky who he goes to, so please read through the entire description before applying for him. Benz was picked up on the streets of Lockhart with his brother at just 8 months old. Benz has been doing great on his leash walking and has picked up so many good behaviors and tricks.... Benz gets along with lots of dogs and is very trainable. \n\nBenz is still young and is going through a fear period right now. New things make him put on the breaks, but if you are patient with him, he comes around. He spent some time at the trainers house where he really likes laying around outside or in the different dog beds. He is NOT the kind of dog you can adopt today and bring to the dog park tomorrow. Benz will need someone who is patient and willing to let him do certain things on his own.\n\nBenz was fostered by a wonderful family who desperately wanted him after the first day home. He fit in great with their other dog and LOVED the laid back, quite lifestyle they were providing. Unfortunately Benz is still working through his fear period and he is reactive right now to small children. Other than that the fosters said he was perfect in every way. So smart and so kind. He is the trainer's house currently working through his child issues and is doing quite well (videos posted soon) but he is not completely comfortable around kids. Therefore we will not be adopting Benz to anyone who has small children at this time. Nor anyone who lives in a apartment or in a neighborhood with lots of kids around so that Benz can continue his wonderful progress. \n\nBenz is NOT looking for a super active outdoor lifestyle. He is VERY content laying around the house or the back yard. He doesn't need long walks and would prefer at this stage to not venture out to dog parks or other outings. But he definitely has energy playing and run with a person or another dog. After all, he's still a big puppy! In my opinion, This boy would be PERFECT for someone who lives a little more isolated, doesn't have kids around (for now), and is looking for a \"hang out with you\" companion. Someone who is patient and will let Benz decide things at his own pace. For example, he's been at the trainer's house for a week now and doesn't feel like coming inside. He's very happy to sleep in the climate controlled dog room... so that's where he hangs. For 2 days he wouldn't go in his new crate, so he didn't have to. After a few feedings with the door open, he goes in happily and stays in for hours when needed. He's SUPER smart...SUPER willing to shape new behaviors...and SUPER chilled. He does, however, mimic the dogs around him... so if your current dog is a fence fighter or reactive, Benz is NOT the dog for you because he will gladly do the same...all 60 lbs of him! \n\nIf you think you can provide the safe, loving home Benz so desperately deserves, We want to hear from you!!! You can apply for Benz TODAY! Please visit our website, YouTube Channel, or Facebook page for more information. www.pawsinprison.com @pawsinprison Paws In Prison-Lockhart, TX",

I was recently seized from another rescue where I was never neutered or treated for my heartworm disease. Due to my lack of treatment, the nice folks here will have to do the old fashioned, long heartworm treatment. I could really use some manners especially when it comes to walking on a leash. I promise to work on my negatives while I\u2019m recuperating. If you\u2019d like to meet me , call The Healthy Hearts and Paws Project. \n\nLicks and tail wags, Vern ??",

            "description": "Lilly has a heart of gold and is eager to please her humans. She is a 7 year old pit terrier mix with the cutest floppy ears, who has been through a lot in her day - including surviving heart worm. She loves treats and is a quiet girl. She will need a home with patient humans who can show her that love and consistency exist. Once she forms a bond with her human(s), she is very loyal and loving.\n\n\n\nShe must have graduated at the top of her manners class. She is fully house trained, does not jump on furniture or people, she doesn\u2019t bark at guests or distractions outside. She has a thing for shoes, but rather than chewing them she cuddles with them. She is crate trained and behaves well enough to be left loose in the house.\n\n\n\nShe is the perfect mix of athletic and calm. She is content cuddling in her bed most of the day, but can run for miles. She is great in the car and loves to go for rides with you. She finds long walks and new places stressful, taking comfort in slow, peaceful introductions to new things. With patience, positive reinforcement, and baby steps she may warm up to being an adventure dog, but for now she likes to sniff in yards or open parks (not dog parks). \n\n\n\nShe needs a home with no other pets as she has a history of dog and cat aggression and prefers a fenced back yard that she can sniff and play in.\n\n\n\n",

She comes off a bit shy and hesitant till she knows you.    Once she warms up she will be all over you.  You will have to visit a few times to see how things go.    She does okay with all volunteers and gets along with other dogs, but can be a bit like a mother to the other dogs at times.   She is learning to walk on a leash and is currently involved in our dog walking program to gain more confidence.  She is not good with bigger dogs. At this moment no kids under 10. \n\n\nDue to the high demand for puppies/dogs we anticipate multiple applications on any of our dogs/puppies. We will review each submitted application, then contact the approved adopter via email. If that particular person has changed their mind we will move to the next approved adopter. Thank you for understanding. If you are interested please complete an application at www.arf-fresno.com   \n\n\nAdoption fee for this dog will be $200.00, which helps with the expenses for spaying or neutering your pet, all vaccinations, including rabies up to date, microchip, and any other grooming or medical care that was needed when the dog was rescued by ARF.     \n\n\n\nIf you would like to fill out an application online, you can go to our website at www.arf-fresno.com, click on the Adoption Section and complete the application.      \n\nAnimal Rescue of Fresno is located at 4545 East Dakota Ave., Fresno, CA 93726 Visit our website, facebook fan page or call us for our current ours.

            "description": "Kiiro was born to a stray mama in the rescuer's neighborhood.  He was taken in after weaning and she has worked with him extensively.  \n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in Dec. 2019, Kiiro is still mostly puppy.  His mama is American Staffordshire mix and dad is husky with either Carolina Dog or shepherd genes.\n\nKiiro is a sweet boy, but will bark initially at strangers and views them with suspicion.  He prefers other polite dogs.\n\nKiiro gets along with cats and ignores the ones in his foster home.   He'll chew, so should be offered plenty of authorized things to chew on.  He's house-trained and leash-trained with very gentle manners under most circumstances.  \n\nBarking is typical in a new home environment for Kiiro.  He's expressing his discomfort, but will settle in within a few days.  We recommend his new family crate him when he can't be supervised as he's been known to jump on his foster's kitchen table.  He's most comfortable in a 42\" crate so he can sprawl if he chooses.  An old (but clean) blanket to lay on is preferred so he isn't laying on a hard surface.\n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

            "description": "Brenna strayed into her rescuer's yard and blessed them with a litter of puppies.\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in July 2019, Brenna weighs about 45 lb.\n\nBrenna's reliably house-trained when kept on a regular schedule.  She is comfortable in a 42\" crate, but doesn't need one overnight.  She'll sleep on the bed or couch if allowed, so may need to be crated when unsupervised if this isn't acceptable in her new home.\n\nBrenna is good with polite dogs and okay with cats.  She likes people once introduced.  She seems nervous riding in cars, so care should be taken that she doesn't jump out when the door is opened.  She's leash savvy, but loves to run in her yard.\n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

            "description": "Cool Hand Luke, 2, greets us each morning with a double-eared salute and a Mona Lisa smile on his face. He's one of those dogs who NEEDS his own Instagram account, mostly because we can't bear to be without seeing his sweet face every day.\nIt's hard to tell what he's thinking - but he's always got his head tilted, and that crooked little smile beaming up at us. This boy has swagger and sweetness. Luke is a gentle, curious guy with a kind of dreamy personality. He always looks like he's lost in thought, floating somewhere, a million miles away from the hustle of shelter life.\nOn leash, Luke is more focused and has begun checking in with us on walks, growing more attentive the more he relaxes.\nLuke came to us from Albany Humane Society, where he had a reputation for being and easy guy who is good with other dogs. He would love to end up with someone who is playful and fun, and a more active home would be ideal for him.\nIf you're interested in a friendly, gentle, independent guy, he is so worth a look. Please fill our an application and email it to us. We'll set up a time for you to come out and spend some time with him. We are pretty surge you're going to love him.\n",

Left behind at our gate one night, when this petite wigglebottom unicorn first smiled up at us, something inside us shifted a little. Because, look! Look at those tiny, crooked little picket fence toofers! With a couple missing up front! When Cheese smiles, 2020 doesn't seem so bad after all. Pandemic? Who cares? You've got Cheese! What else do you need? Okay, a bottle of wine. You need a bottle of wine. But, still; you're halfway there! Cheese is crazy about people and is unapologetically flirtatious with everyone who crosses her path. This girl has no shame, and we adore her for it. She's the kind of dog who will break out into a happy dance when you walk back inside from getting the mail. YES! You're back! That was the loneliest 36 seconds ever! Welcome home - now rub the belly!\nWe don't know her backstory, but Cheese will need to be an only dog in her new home. People are her thing - other dogs? Not so much. If you're looking for a joyful, wiggly, affectionate companion, please fill out an application for Cheesy-Cheese. Email it to info@pawsatlanta.org and we'll get you set up to come out and meet our girl. She's the bomb, y'all.",

He is a loyal work from home office dog and does well staying in his kennel when his people are gone. Malcolm's personality is the perfect blend of soft and sweet with a punch of energy once he gets to trust his people. Malcolm is a very special dog and due to his incredible initial shyness, he is going to need just the right adopter to help him shine. You can learn more about Malcolm and see more photos on instagram @adoptaustindogs or reach out to Austin Animal Center to be put in touch with his foster family. Please note, because of his shyness, Malcolm's foster family asks that potential adopters commit to meeting him several times (they have a large yard that is perfect for social distancing) to get to know him before moving forward with adoption. Malcolm weighs approximately 60 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

I will be the only animal in the home so I can get all the love and attention.\n\n** all meets are being done by appt only so please fill out an online app and once process we will contact you with next steps, It takes 24 to 48 hours to process applications**",

He does okay for a bit, but is dominate with the other dogs if they react in a manner he doesn't like. He is also not the biggest fan of felines. We are recommending that Stanley be the only animal in the home, but that's okay. Stanley is all the companionship you will need!\n\nMeet Stanley! Stanley is such a gentleman that he even stands with his 2 front paws together, making him look so distinguished! Stanley is brand new to the shelter environment. He did not test well with another male dog, but we will test him again once he has adjusted to his environment a bit more. He had no reaction to the cats nearby.\n\n \n\nStanley is currently a resident at Vermilion Parish Animal Control. He will be vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped upon placement in an adoptive or foster home. To adopt, complete the adoption application at AAVArescue.com.",
